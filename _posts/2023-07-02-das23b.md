abstract: Probabilistic, hierarchically coherent forecasting is a key problem in many
  practical forecasting applications â€“ the goal is to obtain coherent probabilistic
  predictions for a large number of  time series  arranged in a pre-specified tree
  hierarchy.  In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep  probabilistic model for
  hierarchical forecasting that is motivated by a classical top-down strategy. It
  jointly learns the distribution of the root time series, and the (dirichlet) proportions
  according to which each parent time-series is split among its children at any point
  in time. The resulting forecasts are naturally coherent, and provide probabilistic
  predictions over all time series in the hierarchy. We experiment on several public
  datasets and demonstrate significant improvements of up to 26% on most datasets
  compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Finally, we also provide theoretical justification
  for the superiority of our top-down approach compared to the more traditional bottom-up
  modeling.
