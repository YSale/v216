abstract: Point processes often have a natural interpretation with respect to a continuous
  process. We propose a point process construction that describes arrival time observations
  in terms of the state of a latent diffusion process. In this framework, we relate
  the return times of a diffusion in a continuous path space to new arrivals of the
  point process. This leads to a continuous sample path that is used to describe the
  underlying mechanism generating the arrival distribution. These models arise in
  many disciplines, such as financial settings where actions in a market are determined
  by a hidden continuous price or in neuroscience where a latent stimulus generates
  spike trains. Based on the developments in Itô’s excursion theory, we propose methods
  for inferring and sampling from the point process derived from the latent diffusion
  process. We illustrate the approach with numerical examples using both simulated
  and real data. The proposed methods and framework provide a basis for interpreting
  point processes through the lens of diffusions.
