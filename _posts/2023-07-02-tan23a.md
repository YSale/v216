abstract: 'Bayesian optimization is a popular method for optimizing expensive black-box
  functions. Yet it oftentimes struggles in high dimensions, where the computation
  could be prohibitively heavy. While a complex kernel with many length scales is
  prone to overfitting and expensive to train, a simple coarse kernel with too few
  length scales cannot effectively capture the variations of the high dimensional
  function in different directions. To alleviate this problem, we introduce CobBO:
  a Bayesian optimization algorithm with two-stage kernels and a coordinate backoff
  stopping rule. It adaptively selects a promising low dimensional subspace and projects
  past measurements into it using a computational efficient coarse kernel. Within
  the subspace, the computational cost of conducting Bayesian optimization with a
  more flexible and accurate kernel becomes affordable and thus a sequence of consecutive
  observations in the same subspace are collected until a stopping rule is met. Extensive
  evaluations show that CobBO finds solutions comparable to or better than other state-of-the-art
  methods for dimensions ranging from tens to hundreds, while reducing both the trial
  complexity and computational costs.'
