abstract: We describe a simple two-party protocol in which each party contributes
  a set as input. The output of the protocol is an estimate of the cardinality of
  the intersection of the two input sets. We show that our protocol is efficient and
  secure. We show that the space complexity and communication complexity are constant,
  the time complexity for each party is proportional to the size of their input set,
  and that our protocol is differentially private. We also analyze the distribution
  of the output of the protocol, deriving both its asymptotic distribution and finite-sample
  bounds on its tail probabilities. These analyses show that, when the input sets
  are large, our protocol produces accurate set intersection cardinality estimates.
  We claim that our protocol is an attractive alternative to traditional private set
  intersection cardinality (PSI-CA) protocols when the input sets are large, exact
  precision is not required, and differential privacy on its own can provide sufficient
  protection to the underlying sensitive data.
