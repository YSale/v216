abstract: Assessing the validity of a real-world system with respect to given quality
  criteria is a common yet costly task in industrial applications due to the vast
  number of required real-world tests. Validating such systems by means of simulation
  offers a promising and less expensive alternative, but requires an assessment of
  the simulation accuracy and therefore end-to-end measurements. Additionally, covariate
  shifts between simulations and actual usage can cause difficulties for estimating
  the reliability of such systems. In this work, we present a validation method that
  propagates bounds on distributional discrepancy measures through a composite system,
  thereby allowing us to derive an upper bound on the failure probability of the real
  system from potentially inaccurate simulations. Each propagation step entails an
  optimization problem, where – for measures such as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD)
  – we develop tight convex relaxations based on semidefinite programs. We demonstrate
  that our propagation method yields valid and useful bounds for composite systems
  exhibiting a variety of realistic effects. In particular, we show that the proposed
  method can successfully account for data shifts within the experimental design as
  well as model inaccuracies within the simulation.
