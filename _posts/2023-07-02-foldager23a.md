abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a popular method for black-box optimization,
  which relies on uncertainty as part of its decision-making process when deciding
  which experiment to perform next. However, not much work has addressed the effect
  of uncertainty on the performance of the BO algorithm and to what extent calibrated
  uncertainties improve the ability to find the global optimum. In this work, we provide
  an extensive study of the relationship between the BO performance (regret) and uncertainty
  calibration for popular surrogate models and acquisition functions, and compare
  them across both synthetic and real-world experiments. Our results show that Gaussian
  Processes, and more surprisingly, Deep Ensembles are strong surrogate models. Our
  results further show a positive association between calibration error and regret,
  but interestingly, this association disappears  when we control for the type of
  surrogate model in the analysis. We also study the effect of recalibration and demonstrate
  that it generally does not lead to improved regret. Finally, we provide theoretical
  justification for why uncertainty calibration might be difficult to combine with
  BO due to the small sample sizes commonly used.
