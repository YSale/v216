abstract: Machine Learning models have emerged as a powerful tool for fast and accurate
  prediction of different crystalline properties. Exiting state-of-the-art models
  rely on a single modality of crystal data i.e crystal graph structure, where they
  construct multi-graph by establishing edges between nearby atoms in 3D space and
  apply GNN to learn materials representation. Thereby, they encode local chemical
  semantics around the atoms successfully but fail to capture important global periodic
  structural information like space group number, crystal symmetry, rotational information
  etc, which influence different crystal properties.  In this work, we leverage textual
  descriptions of materials to model global structural information into graph structure
  and learn a more robust and enriched representation of crystalline materials. To
  this effect, we first curate a textual dataset for crystalline material databases
  containing descriptions of each material. Further, we propose CrysMMNet, a simple
  multi-modal framework, which fuses both structural and textual representation together
  to generate a joint multimodal representation of crystalline materials. We conduct
  extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets across ten different properties
  to show that CrysMMNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods with
  a good margin. We also observe that fusing the textual representation with crystal
  graph structure provides consistent improvement for all the SOTA GNN models compared
  to their own vanilla versions. We have shared the textual dataset, that we have
  curated for both the benchmark material databases, with the community for future
  use..
