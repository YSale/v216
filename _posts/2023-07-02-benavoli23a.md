abstract: 'In consumer theory, ranking available objects by means of preference relations
  yields the most common description of individual choices. However, preference-based
  models assume that individuals: (1) give their preferences only between pairs of
  objects; (2) are always able to pick the best preferred object. In many situations,
  they may be instead choosing out of a set with more than two elements and, because
  of lack of information and/or incomparability (objects with contradictory characteristics),
  they may not be able to select a single most preferred object. To address these
  situations, we need a choice model which allows an individual to express a set-valued
  choice. Choice functions provide such a mathematical framework. We propose a Gaussian
  Process model to learn choice functions from choice data. The model assumes a multiple
  utility representation of a choice function based on the concept of Pareto rationalization,
  and derives a strategy to learn both the number and the values of these latent multiple
  utilities. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms
  the state-of-the-art methods.'
