abstract: We consider the problem of increasing the expressivity of probabilistic
  circuits by augmenting them with the successful generative models of normalizing
  flows. To this effect, we theoretically establish the requirement of decomposability
  for such combinations to retain tractability of the learned models. Our model, called
  Probabilistic Flow Circuits, essentially extends circuits by allowing for normalizing
  flows at the leaves. Our empirical evaluation clearly establishes the expressivity
  and tractability of this new class of probabilistic circuits.
