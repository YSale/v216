abstract: A simple approach to test for conditional independence of two random vectors
  given a third random vector is to simultaneously test for conditional independence
  of every pair of components of the two random vectors given the third random vector.
  In this work, we show that conditioning on additional components of the two random
  vectors that are independent given the third one increases the testsâ€™ effect sizes
  while leaving the validity of the overall approach unchanged. We leverage this result
  to derive a practical pairwise testing algorithm that first chooses tests with a
  relatively large effect size and then does the actual testing. We show both numerically
  and theoretically that our algorithm outperforms standard pairwise independence
  testing and other existing methods if the dependence within the two random vectors
  is sufficiently high.
