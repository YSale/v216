abstract: This work considers the problem of transferring causal knowledge between
  tasks for Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) estimation. To this end, we theoretically
  assess the feasibility of transferring ITE knowledge and present a practical framework
  for efficient transfer. A lower bound is introduced on the ITE error of the target
  task to demonstrate that ITE knowledge transfer is challenging due to the absence
  of counterfactual information. Nevertheless, we establish generalization upper bounds
  on the counterfactual loss and ITE error of the target task, demonstrating the feasibility
  of ITE knowledge transfer. Subsequently, we introduce a framework with a new Causal
  Inference Task Affinity (CITA) measure for ITE knowledge transfer. Specifically,
  we use CITA to find the closest source task to the target task and utilize it for
  ITE knowledge transfer. Empirical studies are provided, demonstrating the efficacy
  of the proposed method. We observe that ITE knowledge transfer can significantly
  (up to 95%) reduce the amount of data required for ITE estimation.
