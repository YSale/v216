abstract: Most existing approaches of differentially private (DP) machine learning
  focus on <em>private training</em>.  Despite its many advantages, <em>private training</em>
  lacks the flexibility in adapting to incremental changes to the training dataset
  such as deletion requests from exercising GDPR’s right to be forgotten. We revisit
  a long-forgotten alternative, known as <em>private prediction</em>, and propose
  a new algorithm named <em>Individual Kernelized Nearest Neighbor</em> (Ind-KNN).
  Ind-KNN is easily updatable over dataset changes and it allows precise control of
  the Rényi DP at an individual user level — a user’s privacy loss is measured by
  the exact amount of her contribution to predictions; and a user is removed if her
  prescribed privacy budget runs out. Our results show that Ind-KNN consistently improves
  the accuracy over existing private prediction methods for a wide range of epsilon
  on four vision and language tasks. We also illustrate several cases under which
  Ind-KNN is preferable over private training with NoisySGD.
