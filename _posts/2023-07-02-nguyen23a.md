abstract: We consider transferability estimation, the problem of estimating how well
  deep learning models transfer from a source to a target task. We focus on regression
  tasks, which received little previous attention, and propose two simple and computationally
  efficient approaches that estimate transferability based on the negative regularized
  mean squared error of a linear regression model. We prove novel theoretical results
  connecting our approaches to the actual transferability of the optimal target models
  obtained from the transfer learning process. Despite their simplicity, our approaches
  significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art regression transferability estimators
  in both accuracy and efficiency. On two large-scale keypoint regression benchmarks,
  our approaches yield 12% to 36% better results on average while being at least 27%
  faster than previous state-of-the-art methods.
