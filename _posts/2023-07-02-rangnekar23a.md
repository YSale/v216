abstract: Dense regression is a widely used approach in computer vision for tasks
  such as image super-resolution, enhancement, depth estimation, etc. However, the
  high cost of annotation and labeling makes it challenging to achieve accurate results.
  We propose incorporating active learning into dense regression models to address
  this problem. Active learning allows models to select the most informative samples
  for labeling, reducing the overall annotation cost while improving performance.
  Despite its potential, active learning has not been widely explored in high-dimensional
  computer vision regression tasks like super-resolution. We address this research
  gap and propose a new framework called USIM-DAL that leverages the statistical properties
  of colour images to learn informative priors using probabilistic deep neural networks
  that model the heteroscedastic predictive distribution allowing uncertainty quantification.
  Moreover, the aleatoric uncertainty from the network serves as a proxy for error
  that is used for active learning. Our experiments on a wide variety of datasets
  spanning applications in natural images (visual genome, BSD100), medical imaging
  (histopathology slides), and remote sensing (satellite images) demonstrate the efficacy
  of the newly proposed USIM-DAL and superiority over several dense regression active
  learning methods.
