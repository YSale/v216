abstract: We study causal effect estimation from a mixture of observational and interventional
  data in a confounded linear regression model with multivariate treatments. We show
  that the statistical efficiency in terms of expected squared error can be improved
  by combining estimators arising from both the observational and interventional setting.
  To this end, we derive methods based on matrix weighted linear estimators and prove
  that our methods are asymptotically unbiased in the infinite sample limit. This
  is an important improvement compared to the pooled estimator using the union of
  interventional and observational data, for which the bias only vanishes if the ratio
  of observational to interventional data tends to zero. Studies on synthetic data
  confirm our theoretical findings. In settings where confounding is substantial and
  the ratio of observational to interventional data is large, our estimators outperform
  a Stein-type estimator and various other baselines.
