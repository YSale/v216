abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks designing adversarial examples for unseen
  deep neural networks (DNNs) have received great attention over the past years. However,
  the underlying factors driving the transferability of black-box adversarial examples
  still lack a thorough understanding. In this paper, we aim to demonstrate the role
  of the generalization behavior of the substitute classifier used for generating
  adversarial examples in the transferability of the attack scheme to unobserved DNN
  classifiers. To do this, we apply the max-min adversarial example game framework
  and show the importance of the generalization properties of the substitute DNN from
  training to test data in the success of the black-box attack scheme in application
  to different DNN classifiers. We prove theoretical generalization bounds on the
  difference between the attack transferability rates on training and test samples.
  Our bounds suggest that operator norm-based regularization methods could improve
  the transferability of the designed adversarial examples. We support our theoretical
  results by performing several numerical experiments showing the role of the substitute
  networkâ€™s generalization in generating transferable adversarial examples. Our empirical
  results indicate the power of Lipschitz regularization and early stopping methods
  in improving the transferability of designed adversarial examples.
