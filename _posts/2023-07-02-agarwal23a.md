abstract: 'Deep generative models like variational autoencoders (VAEs) are widely
  used for density estimation and dimensionality reduction, but infer latent representations
  via amortized inference algorithms, which require that all data dimensions are observed.
  VAEs thus lack a key strength of probabilistic graphical models: the ability to
  infer posteriors for test queries with arbitrary structure. We demonstrate that
  many prior methods for imputation with VAEs are costly and ineffective, and achieve
  superior performance via query-adaptive variational inference (QAVI) algorithms
  based directly on the generative decoder.  By analytically marginalizing arbitrary
  sets of missing features, and optimizing expressive posteriors including mixtures
  and density flows, our non-amortized QAVI algorithms achieve excellent performance
  while avoiding expensive model retraining. On standard image and tabular datasets,
  our approach substantially outperforms prior methods in the plausibility and diversity
  of imputations.  We also show that QAVI effectively generalizes to recent hierarchical
  VAE models for high-dimensional images.'
