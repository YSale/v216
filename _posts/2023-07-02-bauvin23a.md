abstract: Ensemble methods are a very diverse family of algorithms with a wide range
  of applications. One of the most commonly used is boosting, with the prominent Adaboost.
  Adaboost relies on greedily learning base classifiers that rectify the error from
  previous iterations. Then, it combines them through a weighted majority vote, based
  on their quality on the entire learning set. In this paper, we propose a supervised
  binary classification framework that propagates the local knowledge acquired during
  the boosting iterations to the prediction function. Based on this general framework,
  we introduce SamBA, an interpretable greedy ensemble method designed for fat datasets,
  with a large number of dimensions and a small number of samples. SamBA learns local
  classifiers and combines them, using a similarity function, to optimize its efficiency
  in data extraction. We provide a theoretical analysis of SamBA, yielding convergence
  and generalization guarantees. In addition, we highlight SamBA’s empirical behavior
  in an extensive experimental analysis on both real biological and generated datasets,
  comparing it to state-of-the-art ensemble methods and similarity-based approaches.
