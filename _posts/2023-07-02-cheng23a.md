abstract: Randomized experiments (REs) are the cornerstone for treatment effect evaluation.
  However, due to practical considerations, REs may encounter difficulty recruiting
  sufficient patients. External controls (ECs) can supplement REs to boost estimation
  efficiency. Yet, there may be incomparability between ECs and concurrent controls
  (CCs), resulting in misleading treatment effect evaluation. We introduce a novel
  bias function to measure the difference in the outcome mean functions between ECs
  and CCs. We show that the ANCOVA model augmented by the bias function for ECs renders
  a consistent estimator of the average treatment effect, regardless of whether or
  not the ANCOVA model is correct.  To accommodate possibly different structures of
  the ANCOVA model and the bias function, we propose a double penalty integration
  estimator (DPIE) with different penalization terms for the two functions. With an
  appropriate choice of penalty parameters, our DPIE ensures consistency, oracle property,
  and asymptotic normality even in the presence of model misspecification. DPIE is
  at least as efficient as the estimator derived from REs alone, validated through
  theoretical and experimental results.
