abstract: Generation of molecules with desired chemical and biological properties
  such as high drug-likeness, high binding affinity to target proteins, is critical
  for drug discovery. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model to
  capture the joint distribution of molecules and their properties. Our model assumes
  an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space. Conditional on the latent vector,
  the molecule and its properties are modeled by a molecule generation model and a
  property regression model respectively.  To search for molecules with desired properties,  we
  propose a sampling with gradual distribution shifting (SGDS) algorithm, so that
  after learning the model initially on the training data of existing molecules and
  their properties, the proposed algorithm gradually shifts the model distribution
  towards the region supported by molecules with desired values of properties. Our
  experiments show that our method achieves very strong performances on various molecule
  design tasks.
