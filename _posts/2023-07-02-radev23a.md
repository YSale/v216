abstract: 'This work proposes “jointly amortized neural approximation” (JANA) of intractable
  likelihood functions and posterior densities arising in Bayesian surrogate modeling
  and simulation-based inference. We train three complementary networks in an end-to-end
  fashion: 1) a summary network to compress individual data points, sets, or time
  series into informative embedding vectors; 2) a posterior network to learn an amortized
  approximate posterior; and 3) a likelihood network to learn an amortized approximate
  likelihood. Their interaction opens a new route to amortized marginal likelihood
  and posterior predictive estimation – two important ingredients of Bayesian workflows
  that are often too expensive for standard methods. We benchmark the fidelity of
  JANA on a variety of simulation models against state of-the-art Bayesian methods
  and propose a powerful and interpretable diagnostic for joint calibration. In addition,
  we investigate the ability of recurrent likelihood networks to emulate complex time
  series models without resorting to hand-crafted summary statistics.'
