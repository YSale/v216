abstract: Recently, neural heuristics based on deep learning have reported encouraging
  results for solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs), especially on independent and
  identically distributed (i.i.d.) instances, e.g. <em>uniform</em>. However, in the
  presence of a distribution shift for the testing instances, their performance becomes
  considerably inferior. In this paper, we propose a multi-view graph contrastive
  learning (MVGCL) approach to enhance the generalization across different distributions,
  which exploits a graph pattern learner in a self-supervised fashion to facilitate
  a neural heuristic equipped with an active search scheme. Specifically, our MVGCL
  first leverages graph contrastive learning to extract transferable patterns from
  VRP graphs to attain the generalizable multi-view (i.e. node and graph) representation.
  Then it adopts the learnt node embedding and graph embedding to assist the neural
  heuristic and the active search (during inference) for route construction, respectively.
  Extensive experiments on randomly generated VRP instances of various distributions,
  and the ones from TSPLib and CVRPLib show that our MVGCL is superior to the baselines
  in boosting the cross-distribution generalization performance.
