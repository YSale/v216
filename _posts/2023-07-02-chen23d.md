abstract: 'Physical adversarial attacks can mislead detectors in real-world scenarios
  and have attracted increasing attention. However, most existing works manipulate
  the detectorâ€™s final outputs as attack targets while ignoring the inherent characteristics
  of objects. This can result in attacks being trapped in model-specific local optima
  and reduced transferability. To address this issue, we propose a <em>Multi-layer
  Feature-aware Attack</em> (MFA) that considers the importance of multi-layer features
  and disrupts critical object-aware features that dominate decision-making across
  different models. Specifically, we leverage the location and category information
  of detector outputs to assign attribution scores to different feature layers. Then,
  we weight each feature according to their attribution results and design a pixel-level
  loss function in the opposite optimized direction of object detection to generate
  adversarial camouflages. We conduct extensive experiments in both digital and physical
  worlds on ten outstanding detection models and demonstrate the superior performance
  of MFA in terms of attacking capability and transferability. Our code is available
  at: \url{https://github.com/ChenWen1997/MFA}.'
