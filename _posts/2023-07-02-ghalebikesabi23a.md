abstract: Bayesian methods are a popular choice for statistical inference in small-data
  regimes due to the regularization effect induced by the prior. %, which serves to
  counteract overfitting. In the context of density estimation, the standard nonparametric
  Bayesian approach is to target the posterior predictive of the Dirichlet process
  mixture model. In general, direct estimation of the posterior predictive is intractable
  and so methods typically resort to approximating the posterior distribution as an
  intermediate step. The recent development of quasi-Bayesian predictive copula updates,
  however, has made it possible to perform tractable predictive density estimation
  without the need for posterior approximation. Although these estimators are computationally
  appealing, they struggle on non-smooth data distributions. This is due to the comparatively
  restrictive form of the likelihood models from which the proposed copula updates
  were derived. To address this shortcoming, we consider a Bayesian nonparametric
  model with an autoregressive likelihood decomposition and a Gaussian process prior.
  While the predictive update of such a model is typically intractable, we derive
  a quasi-Bayesian update that achieves state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes.
