abstract: Learning and understanding heterogeneous patterns in complex spatio-temporal
  data is an important and challenging task across domains in science and engineering.
  In this work, we develop a model for learning heterogeneous and dynamic patterns
  of velocity field data, motivated by applications in the transportation domain.
  We draw from basic nonparametric Bayesian modeling elements such as the infinite
  hidden Markov model and Gaussian process and focus on making the learning of such
  a stochastic model scalable for voluminous and streaming data. This is achieved
  by employing sequential MAP estimates from the infinite HMM model, an efficient
  sequential sparse GP posterior computation, and refinement of the estimates using
  the Viterbi algorithm, which is shown to work effectively on a careful simulation
  study. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques to the NGSIM dataset of complex
  multi-vehicle interactions.
