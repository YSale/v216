abstract: As a natural extension to the standard conformal prediction method, several
  conformal risk control methods have been recently developed and applied to various
  learning problems. In this work, we seek to control the conformal risk in expectation
  for ordinal classification tasks, which have broad applications to many real problems.
  For this purpose, we firstly formulated the ordinal classification task in the conformal
  risk control framework, and provided theoretic risk bounds of the risk control method.
  Then we proposed two types of loss functions specially designed for ordinal classification
  tasks, and developed corresponding algorithms to determine the prediction set for
  each case to control their risks at a desired level. We demonstrated the effectiveness
  of our proposed methods, and analyzed the difference between the two types of risks
  on three different datasets, including a simulated dataset, the UTKFace dataset
  and  the diabetic retinopathy detection dataset.
