abstract: Understanding the differences between machine learning (ML) models is of
  interest in scenarios ranging from choosing amongst a set of competing models, to
  updating a deployed model with new training data. In these cases, we wish to go
  beyond differences in overall metrics such as accuracy to identify where in the
  feature space do the differences occur. We formalize this problem of model differencing
  as one of predicting a dissimilarity function of two ML models’ outputs, subject
  to the representation of the differences being human-interpretable. Our solution
  is to learn a Joint Surrogate Tree (JST), which is composed of two conjoined decision
  tree surrogates for the two models. A JST provides an intuitive representation of
  differences and places the changes in the context of the models’ decision logic.
  Context is important as it helps users to map differences to an underlying mental
  model of an AI system. We also propose a refinement procedure to increase the precision
  of a JST. We demonstrate, through an empirical evaluation, that such contextual
  differencing is concise and can be achieved with no loss in fidelity over naive
  approaches.
