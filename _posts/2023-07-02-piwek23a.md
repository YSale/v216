abstract: Classic learning theory suggests that proper regularization is the key to
  good generalization and robustness. In classification, current training schemes
  only target the complexity of the classifier itself, which can be misleading and
  ineffective. Instead, we advocate directly measuring the complexity of the decision
  boundary. Existing literature is limited in this area with few well-established
  definitions of boundary complexity. As a proof of concept, we start by analyzing
  ReLU neural networks, whose boundary complexity can be conveniently characterized
  by the number of affine pieces. With the help of tropical geometry, we develop a
  novel method that can explicitly count the exact number of boundary pieces, and
  as a by-product, the exact number of total affine pieces. Numerical experiments
  are conducted and distinctive properties of our boundary complexity are uncovered.
  First, the boundary piece count appears largely independent of other measures, e.g.,
  total piece count, and $l_2$ norm of weights, during the training process. Second,
  the boundary piece count is negatively correlated with robustness, where popular
  robust training techniques, e.g., adversarial training or random noise injection,
  are found to reduce the number of boundary pieces.
