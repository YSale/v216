abstract: 'Multi-modal high throughput biological data presents a great scientific
  opportunity and a significant computational challenge. In multi-modal measurements,
  every sample is observed simultaneously by two or more sets of sensors. In such
  settings, many observed variables in both modalities are often nuisance and do not
  carry information about the phenomenon of interest. Here, we propose a multi-modal
  unsupervised feature selection framework: identifying informative variables based
  on coupled high-dimensional measurements. Our method is designed to identify features
  associated with two types of latent low-dimensional structures: (i) shared structures
  that govern the observations in both modalities, and (ii) differential structures
  that appear in only one modality. To that end,  we propose two Laplacian-based scoring
  operators. We incorporate the scores with differentiable gates that mask nuisance
  features and enhance the accuracy of the structure captured by the graph Laplacian.
  The performance of the new scheme is illustrated using synthetic and real datasets,
  including an extended biological application to single-cell multi-omics.'
