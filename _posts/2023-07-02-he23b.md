abstract: Tensor ring (TR) decomposition has recently received increased attention
  due to its superior expressive performance for high-order tensors. However, the
  applicability of traditional TR decomposition algorithms to real-world applications
  is hindered by prevalent large data sizes, missing entries, and corruption with
  outliers. In this work, we propose a scalable and robust TR decomposition algorithm
  capable of handling large-scale tensor data with missing entries and gross corruptions.
  We first develop a novel auto-weighted steepest descent method that can adaptively
  fill the missing entries and identify the outliers during the decomposition process.
  Further, taking advantage of the tensor ring model, we develop a novel fast Gram
  matrix computation (FGMC) approach and a randomized subtensor sketching (RStS) strategy
  which yield significant reduction in storage and computational complexity. Experimental
  results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing TR decomposition
  methods in the presence of outliers, and runs significantly faster than existing
  robust tensor completion algorithms.
