abstract: In the field of reinforcement learning (RL), agents are often tasked with
  solving a variety of problems differing only in their reward functions. In order
  to quickly obtain solutions to unseen problems with new reward functions, a popular
  approach involves functional composition of previously solved tasks. However, previous
  work using such functional composition has primarily focused on specific instances
  of composition functions, whose limiting assumptions allow for exact zero-shot composition.
  Our work unifies these examples and provides a more general framework for compositionality
  in both standard and entropy-regularized RL. We find that, for a broad class of
  functions, the optimal solution for the composite task of interest can be related
  to the known primitive task solutions. Specifically, we present double-sided inequalities
  relating the optimal composite value function to the value functions for the primitive
  tasks. We also show that the regret of using a zero-shot policy can be bounded for
  this class of functions. The derived bounds can be used to develop clipping approaches
  for reducing uncertainty during training, allowing agents to quickly adapt to new
  tasks.
