abstract: Dataset condensation aims to condense the original training dataset into
  a small synthetic dataset for data-efficient learning. The recently proposed dataset
  condensation techniques allow the model trainers with limited resources to learn
  acceptable deep learning models on a small amount of synthetic data. However, in
  an adversarial environment, given the original dataset as a poisoned dataset, dataset
  condensation may encode the poisoning information into the condensed synthetic dataset.
  To explore the vulnerability of dataset condensation to data poisoning, we revisit
  the state-of-the-art targeted data poisoning method and customize a targeted data
  poisoning algorithm for dataset condensation. By executing the two poisoning methods,
  we demonstrate that, when the synthetic dataset is condensed from a poisoned dataset,
  the models trained on the synthetic dataset may predict the targeted sample as the
  attack-targeted label. To defend against data poisoning, we introduce the concept
  of poisoned deviation to quantify the poisoning effect. We further propose a poisoning-resilient
  dataset condensation algorithm with a calibration method to reduce poisoned deviation.
  Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can protect the synthetic
  dataset from data poisoning with minor performance drop.
