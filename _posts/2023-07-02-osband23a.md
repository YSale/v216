abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a popular heuristic for action selection, but
  it requires sampling from a posterior distribution. Unfortunately, this can become
  computationally intractable in complex environments, such as those modeled using
  neural networks. Approximate posterior samples can produce effective actions, but
  only if they reasonably approximate joint predictive distributions of outputs across
  inputs. Notably, accuracy of marginal predictive distributions does not suffice.
  Epistemic neural networks (ENNs) are designed to produce accurate joint predictive
  distributions. We compare a range of ENNs through computational experiments that
  assess their performance in approximating TS across bandit and reinforcement learning
  environments. The results indicate that ENNs serve this purpose well and illustrate
  how the quality of joint predictive distributions drives performance. Further, we
  demonstrate that the <em>epinet</em> – a small additive network that estimates uncertainty
  – matches the performance of large ensembles at orders of magnitude lower computational
  cost. This enables effective application of TS with computation that scales gracefully
  to complex environments.
