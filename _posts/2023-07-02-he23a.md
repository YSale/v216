abstract: There has been significant interest in searching for off-policy Temporal-Difference
  (TD) algorithms that find the same solution that would have been obtained in the
  on-policy regime. An important property of such algorithms is that their expected
  update has the same fixed point as that of On-policy TD($\lambda$), which we call
  <em>loose consistency</em>. Notably, Full-IS-TD($\lambda$) is the only existing
  loosely consistent method under general linear function approximation but, unfortunately,
  has a high variance and is scarcely practical. This notorious high variance issue
  motivates the introduction of ETD($\lambda$), which tames down the variance but
  has a biased fixed point. Inspired by these two methods, we propose a new loosely
  consistent algorithm called <em>Average Emphatic TD</em> (AETD($\lambda$)) with
  a transient bias, which strikes a balance between bias and variance. Further, we
  unify AETD($\lambda$) with existing methods and obtain a new family of loosely consistent
  algorithms called <em>Loosely Consistent Emphatic TD</em> (LC-ETD($\lambda$, $\beta$,
  $\nu$)), which can control a smooth bias-variance trade-off by varying the speed
  at which the transient bias fades. Through experiments on illustrative examples,
  we show the effectiveness and practicality of LC-ETD($\lambda$, $\beta$, $\nu$).
