abstract: Text classifiers built on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have achieved
  remarkable progress in various tasks including sentiment analysis, natural language
  inference, and question-answering. However, the occurrence of uncertain predictions
  by these classifiers poses a challenge to their reliability when deployed in practical
  applications. Much effort has been devoted to designing various probes in order
  to understand what PLMs capture. But few studies have delved into factors influencing
  PLM-based classifiersâ€™ predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel
  framework, called CUE, which aims to interpret uncertainties inherent in the predictions
  of PLM-based models. In particular, we first map PLM-encoded representations to
  a latent space via a variational auto-encoder. We then generate text representations
  by perturbing the latent space which causes fluctuation in predictive uncertainty.
  By comparing the difference in predictive uncertainty between the perturbed and
  the original text representations, we are able to identify the latent dimensions
  responsible for uncertainty and subsequently trace back to the input features that
  contribute to such uncertainty. Our extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
  encompassing linguistic acceptability classification, emotion classification, and
  natural language inference show the feasibility of our proposed framework. Our source
  code is available at https://github.com/lijiazheng99/CUE.
