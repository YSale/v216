abstract: Explaining in accurate and intelligible terms the predictions made by classifiers
  is a key challenge of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). To this end, an
  abductive explanation for the predicted label of some data instance is a subset-minimal
  collection of features such that the restriction of the instance to these features
  is sufficient to determine the prediction. However, due to cognitive limitations,
  abductive explanations are often too large to be interpretable. In those cases,
  we need to reduce the size of abductive explanations, while still determining the
  predicted label with high probability. In this paper, we show that finding such
  probabilistic explanations is NP-hard, even for decision trees. In order to circumvent
  this issue, we investigate the approximability of probabilistic explanations through
  the lens of supermodularity. We examine both greedy descent and greedy ascent approaches
  for supermodular minimization, whose approximation guarantees depend on the curvature
  of the “unnormalized” error function that evaluates the precision of the explanation.
  Based on various experiments for explaining decision tree predictions, we show that
  our greedy algorithms provide an efficient alternative to the state-of-the-art constraint
  optimization method.
