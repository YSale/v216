abstract: Ensemble methods combine multiple individual models for prediction, which
  have demonstrated their effectiveness in accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ)
  and strong robustness. Obtaining a diverse ensemble set of model parameters results
  in better model averaging performance and better approximation of the true posterior
  distribution of these parameters. In this paper, we propose the diversity-enhanced
  probabilistic ensemble method with the adaptive uncertainty-guided ensemble learning
  strategy for better quantifying uncertainty and further improving the model robustness.
  Specifically, we construct the probabilistic ensemble model by building a Gaussian
  distribution of the model parameters for each ensemble component using Laplacian
  approximation in a post-processing manner. Then a mixture of Gaussian model is established
  with learnable and refinable parameters in an EM-like algorithm. During ensemble
  training, we leverage the uncertainty estimated from previous models as guidance
  when training the next one such that the new model will focus more on the less explored
  regions by previous models. Various experiments including out-of-distribution detection
  and image classification under distributional shifts have demonstrated better uncertainty
  estimation and improved model generalization ability of our proposed method.
