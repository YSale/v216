abstract: Under a simplified data model, this paper provides a theoretical analysis
  of learning from data that have an underlying low-rank tensor structure in both
  supervised and unsupervised settings. For the supervised setting, we provide an
  analysis of a Ridge classifier (with high regularization parameter) with and without
  knowledge of the low-rank structure of the data. Our results quantify analytically
  the gain in misclassification errors achieved by exploiting the low-rank structure
  for denoising purposes, as opposed to treating data as mere vectors. We further
  provide a similar analysis in the context of clustering, thereby quantifying the
  exact performance gap between tensor methods and standard approaches which treat
  data as simple vectors.
