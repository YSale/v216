abstract: 'In this paper we study the problem of lower bounding the minimum eigenvalue
  of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) at initialization, an important quantity for
  the theoretical analysis of training in neural networks. We consider feedforward
  neural networks with smooth activation functions. Without any distributional assumptions
  on the input, we present a novel result: we show that for suitable initialization
  variance, $\widetilde{\Omega}(n)$ width, where $n$ is the number of training samples,
  suffices to ensure that the NTK at initialization is positive definite, improving
  prior results for smooth activations under our setting. Prior to our work, the sufficiency
  of linear width has only been shown either for networks with ReLU activation functions,
  and sublinear width has been shown for smooth networks but with additional conditions
  on the distribution of the data. The technical challenge in the analysis stems from
  the layerwise inhomogeneity of smooth activation functions and we handle the challenge
  using {\em generalized} Hermite series expansion of such activations.'
