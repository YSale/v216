abstract: Probabilistic "if A then B" rules are typically formalized as Bayesian conditionals
  P(B|A), as many (e.g., Pearl) have argued that Bayesian conditionals are the correct
  way to think about such rules. However, there are challenges with standard inferences
  such as modus ponens and modus tollens that might make probabilistic material implication
  a better candidate at times for rule-based systems employing forward-chaining; and
  arguably material implication is still suitable when information about prior or
  conditional probabilities is not available at all.  We investigate a generalization
  of probabilistic material implication and Bayesian conditionals that combines the
  advantages of both formalisms in a systematic way and prove basic properties of
  the generalized rule, in particular, for inference chains in graphs.
