abstract: 'Causal discovery from interventional data is an important problem, where
  the task is to design an interventional strategy that learns the hidden ground truth
  causal graph $G(V,E)$ on $|V| = n$ nodes while minimizing the number of performed
  interventions. Most prior interventional strategies broadly fall into two categories:
  non-adaptive and adaptive. Non-adaptive strategies decide on a single fixed set
  of interventions to be performed while adaptive strategies can decide on which nodes
  to intervene on sequentially based on past interventions. While adaptive algorithms
  may use exponentially fewer interventions than their non-adaptive counterparts,
  there are practical concerns that constrain the amount of adaptivity allowed. Motivated
  by this trade-off, we study the problem of $r$-adaptivity, where the algorithm designer
  recovers the causal graph under a total of $r$ sequential rounds whilst trying to
  minimize the total number of interventions. For this problem, we provide a $r$-adaptive
  algorithm that achieves $O(\min\{r,\log n\} \cdot n^{1/\min\{r,\log n\}})$ approximation
  with respect to the verification number, a well-known lower bound for adaptive algorithms.
  Furthermore, for every $r$, we show that our approximation is tight. Our definition
  of $r$-adaptivity interpolates nicely between the non-adaptive ($r=1$) and fully
  adaptive ($r=n$) settings where our approximation simplifies to $O(n)$ and $O(\log
  n)$ respectively, matching the best-known approximation guarantees for both extremes.
  Our results also extend naturally to the bounded size interventions.'
