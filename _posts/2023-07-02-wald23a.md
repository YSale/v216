abstract: In this work, we solve the problem of novel category detection under distribution
  shift. This problem is critical to ensuring the safety and efficacy of machine learning
  models, particularly in domains such as healthcare where timely detection of novel
  subgroups of patients is crucial.  To address this problem, we propose a method
  based on constrained learning. Our approach is guaranteed to detect a novel category
  under a relatively weak assumption, namely that rare events in past data have bounded
  frequency under the shifted distribution. Prior works on the problem do not provide
  such guarantees, as they either attend to very specific types of distribution shift
  or make stringent assumptions that limit their guarantees.  We demonstrate favorable
  performance of our method on challenging novel category detection problems over
  real world datasets.
