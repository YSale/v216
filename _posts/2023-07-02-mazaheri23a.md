abstract: Statistical prediction models are often trained on data that is drawn from
  different probability distributions than their eventual use cases. One approach
  to proactively prepare for these shifts harnesses the intuition that causal mechanisms
  should remain invariant between environments. Here we focus on a challenging setting
  in which the causal and anticausal variables of the target are unobserved. Leaning
  on information theory, we develop feature selection and engineering techniques for
  the observed downstream variables that act as proxies. We identify proxies that
  help to build stable models and moreover utilize auxiliary training tasks to extract
  stability-enhancing information from proxies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
  our techniques on synthetic and real data.
