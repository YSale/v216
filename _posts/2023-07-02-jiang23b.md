abstract: Partial orders are a natural model for the social hierarchies that may constrain
  “queue-like” rank-order data. However, the computational cost of counting the linear
  extensions of a general partial order on a ground set with more than a few tens
  of elements is prohibitive. Vertex-series-parallel partial orders (VSPs) are a subclass
  of partial orders which admit rapid counting and represent the sorts of relations
  we expect to see in a social hierarchy. However, no Bayesian analysis of VSPs has
  been given to date. We construct a marginally consistent family of priors over VSPs
  with a parameter controlling the prior distribution over  VSP depth. The prior for
  VSPs is given in closed form. We extend an existing observation model for queue-like
  rank-order data to represent noise in our data and carry out Bayesian inference
  on “Royal Acta” data and Formula 1 race data. Model comparison shows our model is
  a better fit to the data than Plackett-Luce mixtures, Mallows mixtures, and “bucket
  order” models and competitive with more complex models fitting general partial orders.
