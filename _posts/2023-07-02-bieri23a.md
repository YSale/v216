abstract: We present a novel learning-based method that achieves state-of-the-art
  performance on several heart rate estimation benchmarks extracted from photoplethysmography
  signals (PPG). We consider the evolution of the heart rate in the context of a discrete-time
  stochastic process that we represent as a hidden Markov model. We derive a distribution
  over possible heart rate values for a given PPG signal window through a trained
  neural network. Using belief propagation, we incorporate the statistical distribution
  of heart rate changes to refine these estimates in a temporal context. From this,
  we obtain a quantized probability distribution over the range of possible heart
  rate values that captures a meaningful and well-calibrated estimate of the inherent
  predictive uncertainty. We show the robustness of our method on eight public datasets
  with three different cross-validation experiments.
