abstract: Self-paced reinforcement learning (RL) aims to improve the data efficiency
  of learning by automatically creating sequences, namely curricula, of probability
  distributions over contexts. However, existing techniques for self-paced RL fail
  in long-horizon planning tasks that involve temporally extended behaviors. We hypothesize
  that taking advantage of prior knowledge about the underlying task structure can
  improve the effectiveness of self-paced RL. We develop a self-paced RL algorithm
  guided by reward machines, i.e., a type of finite-state machine that encodes the
  underlying task structure. The algorithm integrates reward machines in 1) the update
  of the policy and value functions obtained by any RL algorithm of choice, and 2)
  the update of the automated curriculum that generates context distributions. Our
  empirical results evidence that the proposed algorithm achieves optimal behavior
  reliably even in cases in which existing baselines cannot make any meaningful progress.
  It also decreases the curriculum length and reduces the variance in the curriculum
  generation process by up to one-fourth and four orders of magnitude, respectively.
