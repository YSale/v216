abstract: 'In this paper, we revisit the problem of Differentially Private Stochastic
  Convex Optimization (DP-SCO) in Euclidean and general $\ell_p^d$ spaces. Specifically,
  we focus on three settings that are still far from well understood:  (1) DP-SCO
  over a  constrained and bounded (convex) set in Euclidean space; (2) unconstrained
  DP-SCO in $\ell_p^d$ space; (3) DP-SCO with heavy-tailed data over a  constrained
  and bounded set in $\ell_p^d$ space. For problem (1), for both convex and strongly
  convex loss functions, we propose methods whose outputs could achieve (expected)
  excess population risks that are only dependent on the Gaussian width of the constraint
  set,  rather than the dimension of the space. Moreover, we also show the bound for
  strongly convex functions is optimal up to a logarithmic factor. For problems (2)
  and (3), we propose several novel  algorithms and provide the first theoretical
  results for both cases when $1<p<2$ and $2\leq p\leq \infty$.'
