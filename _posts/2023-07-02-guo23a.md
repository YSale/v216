abstract: 'Conducting valid statistical analyses is challenging in the presence of
  missing-not-at-random (MNAR) data, where the missingness mechanism is dependent
  on the missing values themselves even conditioned on the observed data. Here, we
  consider a MNAR model that generalizes several prior popular MNAR models in two
  ways: first, it is less restrictive in terms of statistical independence assumptions
  imposed on the underlying joint data distribution, and second, it allows for all
  variables in the observed sample to have missing values. This MNAR model corresponds
  to a so-called criss-cross structure considered in the literature on graphical models
  of missing data that prevents nonparametric identification of the entire missing
  data model. Nonetheless, part of the complete-data distribution remains nonparametrically
  identifiable. By exploiting this fact and considering a rich class of exponential
  family distributions, we establish sufficient conditions for identification of the
  complete-data distribution as well as the entire missingness mechanism. We then
  propose methods for testing the independence restrictions encoded in such models
  using odds ratio as our parameter of interest. We adopt two semiparametric approaches
  for estimating the odds ratio parameter and establish the corresponding asymptotic
  theories: one involves maximizing a conditional likelihood with order statistics
  and the other uses estimating equations. The utility of our methods is illustrated
  via simulation studies.'
