abstract: 'Probabilistic generating circuits (PGCs) are economical representations
  of multivariate probability generating polynomials (PGPs). They unify and extend
  decomposable probabilistic circuits and determinantal point processes, admitting
  tractable computation of marginal probabilities. However, the need for addition
  and multiplication of high-degree polynomials incurs a significant additional factor
  in the complexity of inference. Here, we give a new inference algorithm that eliminates
  this extra factor. Specifically, we show that it suffices to keep track of the highest
  degree coefficients of the computed polynomials, rendering the algorithm linear
  in the circuit size. In addition, we show that determinant-based circuits need not
  be expanded to division-free circuits, but can be handled by division-based fast
  algorithms. While these advances enhance the appeal of PGCs, we also discover an
  obstacle to learning them from data: it is NP-hard to recognize whether a given
  PGC encodes a PGP. We discuss the implications of our ambivalent findings and sketch
  a method, in which learning is restricted to PGCs that are composed of moderate-size
  subcircuits.'
