abstract: We present a new, efficient procedure to establish Markov equivalence between
  directed graphs that may or may not contain cycles. It is based on the Cyclic Equivalence
  Theorem (CET) in the seminal works on cyclic models by Thomas Richardson in the
  mid â€™90s, but now rephrased from an ancestral perspective. The resulting characterization
  leads to a procedure for establishing Markov equivalence between graphs that no
  longer requires explicit tests for $d$-separation, leading to a significantly reduced
  algorithmic complexity. The conceptually simplified characterization may help to
  reinvigorate theoretical research towards sound and complete cyclic discovery in
  the presence of latent confounders.
