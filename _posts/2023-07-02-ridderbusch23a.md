abstract: Computing the distribution of trajectories from a Gaussian Process model
  of a dynamical system is an important challenge in utilizing such models. Motivated
  by the computational cost of sampling-based approaches, we consider approximations
  of the model’s output and trajectory distribution. We show that previous work on
  uncertainty propagation, focussed on discrete state-space models, incorrectly included
  an independence assumption between subsequent states of the predicted trajectories.
  Expanding these ideas to continuous ordinary differential equation models, we illustrate
  the implications of this assumption and propose a novel piecewise linear approximation
  of Gaussian Processes to mitigate them.
