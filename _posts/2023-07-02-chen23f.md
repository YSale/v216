abstract: We consider missingness in the context of causal inference when the outcome
  of interest may be missing. If the outcome directly affects its own missingness
  status, i.e., it is “self-censoring”, this may lead to severely biased causal effect
  estimates. Miao et al. (2015) proposed the shadow variable method to correct for
  bias due to self-censoring; however, verifying the required model assumptions can
  be difficult. Here, we propose a test based on a randomized incentive variable offered
  to encourage reporting of the outcome that can be used to verify identification
  assumptions that are sufficient to correct for both self-censoring and confounding
  bias. Concretely, the test confirms whether a given set of pre-treatment covariates
  is sufficient to block all backdoor paths between the treatment and outcome as well
  as all paths between the treatment and missingness indicator after conditioning
  on the outcome. We show that under these conditions, the causal effect is identified
  by using the treatment as a shadow variable, and it leads to an intuitive inverse
  probability weighting estimator that uses a product of the treatment and response
  weights. We evaluate the efficacy of our test and downstream estimator via simulations.
