abstract: Kernel techniques are among the most popular and powerful approaches of
  data science. Among the key features that make kernels ubiquitous are (i) the number
  of domains they have been designed for, (ii) the Hilbert structure of the function
  class associated to kernels facilitating their statistical analysis, and (iii) their
  ability to represent probability distributions without loss of information. These
  properties give rise to the immense success of Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion
  (HSIC) which is able to capture joint independence of random variables under mild
  conditions, and permits closed-form estimators with quadratic computational complexity
  (w.r.t. the sample size). In order to alleviate the quadratic computational bottleneck
  in large-scale applications, multiple HSIC approximations have been proposed, however
  these estimators are restricted to $M=2$ random variables, do not extend naturally
  to the $M\ge 2$ case, and lack theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose
  an alternative Nyström-based HSIC estimator which handles the $M\ge 2$ case, prove
  its consistency, and  demonstrate its applicability in multiple contexts, including
  synthetic examples, dependency testing of media annotations, and causal discovery.
