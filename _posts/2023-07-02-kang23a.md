abstract: Linear bandit algorithms have been extensively studied and have shown successful
  in sequential decision tasks despite their simplicity. Many algorithms however work
  under the assumption that the reward is the sum of linear function of observed contexts
  and a sub-Gaussian error. In practical applications, errors can be heavy-tailed,
  especially in financial data. In such reward environments, algorithms designed for
  sub-Gaussian error may underexplore, resulting in suboptimal regret. In this paper,
  we relax the reward assumption and propose a novel linear bandit algorithm which
  works well under heavy-tailed errors as well. The proposed algorithm utilizes Huber
  regression. When contexts are stochastic with positive definite covariance matrix
  and the $(1+\delta)$-th moment of the error is bounded by a constant, we show that
  the high-probability upper bound of the regret is $O(\sqrt{d}T^{\frac{1}{1+\delta}}(\log
  dT)^{\frac{\delta}{1+\delta}})$, where $d$ is the dimension of context variables,
  $T$ is the time horizon, and $\delta\in (0,1]$. This bound improves on the state-of-the-art
  regret bound of the Median of Means and Truncation algorithm by a factor of $\sqrt{\log
  T}$ and $\sqrt{d}$ for the case where the time horizon $T$ is unknown. We also remark
  that when $\delta=1$, the order is the same as the regret bound of linear bandit
  algorithms designed for sub-Gaussian errors. We support our theoretical findings
  with synthetic experiments.
