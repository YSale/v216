abstract: "The need to explain the output of a deep neural network classifier is now
  widely recognized. While previous methods typically explain a single class in the
  output, we advocate explaining the whole output, which is a probability distribution
  over multiple classes. A whole-output explanation can help a human user gain an
  overall understanding of model behaviour instead of only one aspect of it. It can
  also provide a natural framework where one can examine the evidence used to discriminate
  between\tcompeting classes, and thereby obtain contrastive explanations. In this
  paper, we propose a contrastive whole-output explanation (CWOX) method for image
  classification, and evaluate it using quantitative metrics and through human subject
  studies. The source code of CWOX is available at https://github.com/vaynexie/CWOX."
