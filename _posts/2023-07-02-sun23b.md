abstract: In representative democracies, regular election cycles are supposed to prevent
  misbehavior by elected officials, hold them accountable, and subject them to the
  â€œwill of the people." Pandering, or dishonest preference reporting by candidates
  campaigning for election, undermines this democratic idea. Much of the work on Computational
  Social Choice to date has investigated strategic actions in only a single election.
  We introduce a novel formal model of pandering and examine the resilience of two
  voting systems, Representative Democracy (RD) and Flexible Representative Democracy
  (FRD), to pandering within a single election and across multiple rounds of elections.
  For both voting systems, our analysis centers on the types of strategies candidates
  employ and how voters update their views of candidates based on how the candidates
  have pandered in the past. We provide theoretical results on the complexity of pandering
  in our setting for a single election, formulate our problem for multiple cycles
  as a Markov Decision Process, and use reinforcement learning to study the effects
  of pandering by single candidates and groups of candidates over many rounds.
