abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is a problem of practical importance
  for a reliable use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in production settings. The corollary
  to this problem is the detection in-distribution (ID) samples, which is applicable
  to domain adaptation scenarios for augmenting a train set with ID samples from other
  data sets, or to continual learning for replay from the past. For both ID or OOD
  detection, we propose a principled yet simple approach of (empirically) estimating
  KL-Divergence, in its dual form, for a given test set w.r.t. a known set of ID samples
  in order to quantify the contribution of each test sample individually towards the
  divergence measure and accordingly detect it as OOD or ID. Our approach is compute-efficient
  and enjoys strong theoretical guarantees. For WideResnet101 and ViT-L-16, by considering
  ImageNet-1k dataset as the ID benchmark, we evaluate the proposed OOD detector on
  51 test (OOD) datasets, and observe drastically and consistently lower false positive
  rates w.r.t. all the competitive methods. Moreover, the proposed ID detector is
  evaluated, using ECG and stock price datasets, for the task of data augmentation
  in domain adaptation and continual learning settings, and we observe higher efficacy
  compared to relevant baselines.
