abstract: Creation of a synthetic dataset that faithfully represents the data distribution
  and simultaneously preserves privacy is a major research challenge. Many space partitioning
  based approaches have emerged in recent years for answering statistical queries
  in a differentially private manner. However, for synthetic data generation problem,
  recent research has been mainly focused on deep generative models. In contrast,
  we exploit space partitioning techniques together with noise perturbation and thus
  achieve intuitive and transparent algorithms. We propose both data independent and
  data dependent algorithms for $\epsilon$-differentially private synthetic data generation
  whose kernel density resembles that of the real dataset. Additionally, we provide
  theoretical results on the utility-privacy trade-offs and show how our data dependent
  approach overcomes the curse of dimensionality and leads to a scalable algorithm.
  We show empirical utility improvements over the prior work, and discuss performance
  of our algorithm on a downstream classification task on a real dataset.
