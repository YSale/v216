abstract: Recent real-world applications of deep learning have led to the development
  of machine learning as a service (MLaaS). However, the scenario of client-server
  inference presents privacy concerns, where the server processes raw data sent from
  the userâ€™s client device. One solution to this issue is to provide an obfuscator
  function to the client device using Adversarial Representation Learning (ARL). Prior
  works have primarily focused on the privacy-utility trade-off while overlooking
  the computational cost and memory burden on the client side. In this paper, we propose
  an effective and efficient ARL method that incorporates feature noise into the ARL
  pipeline. We evaluated our approach on various datasets, comparing it with state-of-the-art
  ARL techniques. Our experimental results indicate that our method achieves better
  accuracy, lower computation and memory overheads, and improved resistance to information
  leakage and reconstruction attacks.
