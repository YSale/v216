abstract: A standard model of a security game assumes a one-off assault during which
  the attacker cannot update their strategy even if new actionable insights are gained
  in the process. In this paper, we propose a version of a security game that takes
  into account a possibility of a two-phase attack. Specifically, in the first phase,
  the attacker makes a preliminary move to gain extra information about this particular
  instance of the game. Based on this information, the attacker chooses an optimal
  concluding move. We derive a compact-form mixed-integer linear program that computes
  an optimal strategy of the defender. Our simulation shows that this strategy mitigates
  serious losses incurred to the defender by a two-phase attack while still protecting
  well against less sophisticated attackers.
