abstract: 'Self-supervised learning (SSL) for graphs is an essential problem since
  graph data are ubiquitous and labeling can be costly. We argue that existing SSL
  approaches for graphs have two limitations. First, they rely on corruption techniques
  such as node attribute perturbation and edge dropping to generate graph views for
  contrastive learning. These unnatural corruption techniques require extensive tuning
  efforts and provide marginal improvements. Second, the current approaches require
  the computation of multiple graph views, which is memory and computationally inefficient.
  These shortcomings of graph SSL call for a corruption-free single-view learning
  approach, but the strawman approach of using neighboring nodes as positive examples
  suffers two problems: it ignores the strength of connections between nodes implied
  by the graph structure on a macro level, and cannot deal with the high noise in
  real-world graphs. We propose Proximity Divergence Minimization (PDM), a corruption-free
  single-view graph SSL approach that overcomes these problems by leveraging node
  proximity to measure connection strength and denoise the graph structure. Through
  extensive experiments, we show that PDM achieves up to 4.55% absolute improvement
  in ROC-AUC on graph SSL tasks over state-of-the-art approaches while being more
  memory efficient. Moreover, PDM even outperforms supervised training on node classification
  tasks of ogbn-proteins dataset. Our code is publicly available.'
