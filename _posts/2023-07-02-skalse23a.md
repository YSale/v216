abstract: In this paper, we study the expressivity of scalar, Markovian reward functions
  in Reinforcement Learning (RL), and identify several limitations to what they can
  express. Specifically, we look at three classes of RL tasks; multi-objective RL,
  risk-sensitive RL, and modal RL. For each class, we derive necessary and sufficient
  conditions that describe when a problem in this class can be expressed using a scalar,
  Markovian reward. Moreover, we find that scalar, Markovian rewards are unable to
  express most of the instances in each of these three classes. We thereby contribute
  to a more complete understanding of what standard reward functions can and cannot
  express. In addition to this, we also call attention to modal problems as a new
  class of problems, since they have so far not been given any systematic treatment
  in the RL literature. We also briefly outline some approaches for solving some of
  the problems we discuss, by means of bespoke RL algorithms.
