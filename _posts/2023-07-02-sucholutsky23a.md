abstract: Supervised learning typically focuses on learning transferable representations
  from training examples annotated by humans. While rich annotations (like soft labels)
  carry more information than sparse annotations (like hard labels), they are also
  more expensive to collect. For example, while hard labels only provide information
  about the closest class an object belongs to (e.g., “this is a dog”), soft labels
  provide information about the object’s relationship with multiple classes (e.g.,
  “this is most likely a dog, but it could also be a wolf or a coyote”). We use information
  theory to compare how a number of commonly-used supervision signals contribute to
  representation-learning performance, as well as how their capacity is affected by
  factors such as the number of labels, classes, dimensions, and noise. Our framework
  provides theoretical justification for using hard labels in the big-data regime,
  but richer supervision signals for few-shot learning and out-of-distribution generalization.
  We validate these results empirically in a series of experiments with over 1 million
  crowdsourced image annotations and conduct a cost-benefit analysis to establish
  a tradeoff curve that enables users to optimize the cost of supervising representation
  learning on their own datasets.
