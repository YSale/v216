abstract: Combining Gaussian processes with the expressive power of deep neural networks
  is commonly done nowadays through deep kernel learning (DKL). Unfortunately, due
  to the kernel optimization process, this often results in losing their Bayesian
  benefits. In this study, we present a novel approach for learning deep kernels by
  utilizing infinite-width neural networks. We propose to use the Neural Network Gaussian
  Process (NNGP) model as a guide to the DKL model in the optimization process. Our
  approach harnesses the reliable uncertainty estimation of the NNGPs to adapt the
  DKL target confidence when it encounters novel data points. As a result, we get
  the best of both worlds, we leverage the Bayesian behavior of the NNGP, namely its
  robustness to overfitting, and accurate uncertainty estimation, while maintaining
  the generalization abilities, scalability, and flexibility of deep kernels. Empirically,
  we show on multiple benchmark datasets of varying sizes and dimensionality, that
  our method is robust to overfitting, has good predictive performance, and provides
  reliable uncertainty estimations.
