abstract: Instance-wise feature selection and ranking methods can achieve a good selection
  of task-friendly features for each sample in the context of neural networks. However,
  existing approaches that assume feature subsets to be independent are imperfect
  when considering the dependency between features. To address this limitation, we
  propose to incorporate the Gaussian copula, a powerful mathematical technique for
  capturing correlations between variables, into the current feature selection framework
  with no additional changes needed. Experimental results on both synthetic and real
  datasets, in terms of performance comparison and interpretability, demonstrate that
  our method is capable of capturing meaningful correlations.
