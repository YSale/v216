abstract: Generative Flow Networks (or GFlowNets for short) are a family of probabilistic
  agents that learn to sample complex combinatorial structures through the lens of
  “inference as control”. They have shown great potential in generating high-quality
  and diverse candidates from a given energy landscape. However, existing GFlowNets
  can be applied only to deterministic environments, and fail in more general tasks
  with stochastic dynamics, which can limit their applicability. To overcome this
  challenge, this paper introduces Stochastic GFlowNets, a new algorithm that extends
  GFlowNets to stochastic environments. By decomposing state transitions into two
  steps, Stochastic GFlowNets isolate environmental stochasticity and learn a dynamics
  model to capture it. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Stochastic
  GFlowNets offer significant advantages over standard GFlowNets as well as MCMC-
  and RL-based approaches, on a variety of standard benchmarks with stochastic dynamics.
