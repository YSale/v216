abstract: We study the design of caching policies in applications such as serverless
  computing where there is not a fixed size cache to be filled, but rather there is
  a cost associated with the time an item stays in the cache.  We present a model
  for such caching policies which captures the trade-off between this cost and the
  cost of cache misses. We characterize optimal caching policies in general and apply
  this characterization by deriving a closed form for Hawkes processes. Since optimal
  policies for Hawkes processes depend on the history of arrivals, we also develop
  history-independent policies which achieve near-optimal average performance. We
  evaluate the performances of the optimal policy and approximate polices using simulations
  and a data trace of Azure Functions, Microsoftâ€™s FaaS (Function as a Service) platform
  for serverless computing
