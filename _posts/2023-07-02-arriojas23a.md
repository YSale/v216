abstract: We develop a novel approach to determine the optimal policy in entropy-regularized
  reinforcement learning (RL) with stochastic dynamics. For deterministic dynamics,
  the optimal policy can be derived using Bayesian inference in the control-as-inference
  framework; however, for stochastic dynamics, the direct use of this approach leads
  to risk-taking optimistic policies. To address this issue, current approaches in
  entropy-regularized RL involve a constrained optimization procedure which fixes
  system dynamics to the original dynamics, however this approach is not consistent
  with the unconstrained Bayesian inference framework. In this work we resolve this
  inconsistency by developing an exact mapping from the constrained optimization problem
  in entropy-regularized RL to a different optimization problem which can be solved
  using the unconstrained Bayesian inference approach. We show that the optimal policies
  are the same for both problems, thus our results lead to the exact solution for
  the optimal policy in entropy-regularized RL with stochastic dynamics through Bayesian
  inference.
