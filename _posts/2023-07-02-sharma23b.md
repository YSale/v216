abstract: 'We study the problem of counting the number of directed acyclic graphs
  in a Markov equivalence class (MEC) that are consistent with <em>background knowledge</em>
  specified in the form of the directions of some additional edges in the MEC.  A
  polynomial-time algorithm for the special case of the problem, when no background
  knowledge  constraints are specified, was given by Wienöbst, Bannach, and Liskiewicz
  (AAAI 2021), who also showed that the general case is NP-hard (in fact, #P-hard).  In
  this paper, we show that the problem is nevertheless tractable in an interesting
  class of instances, by establishing that it is “fixed-parameter tractable”: we give
  an algorithm that runs in time $O(k! k^2 n^4)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes
  in the MEC and $k$ is the maximum number of nodes in any maximal clique of the MEC
  that participate in the specified background knowledge constraints. In particular,
  our algorithm runs in polynomial time in the well-studied special case of MECs of
  bounded tree-width or bounded maximum clique size.'
