abstract: Accurate outlier detection is not only a necessary preprocessing step, but
  can itself give important insights into the data. However, especially, for non-linear
  regression the detection of outliers is non-trivial, and actually ambiguous. We
  propose a new method that identifies outliers by finding a subset of data points
  T such that the marginal likelihood of all remaining data points S is maximized.
  Though the idea is more general, it is particular appealing for Gaussian processes
  regression, where the marginal likelihood has an analytic solution. While maximizing
  the marginal likelihood for hyper-parameter optimization is a well established non-convex
  optimization problem, optimizing the set of data points S is not. Indeed, even a
  greedy approximation is computationally challenging due to the high cost of evaluating
  the marginal likelihood. As a remedy, we propose an efficient projected gradient
  descent method with provable convergence guarantees. Moreover, we also establish
  the breakdown point when jointly optimizing hyper-parameters and S. For various
  datasets and types of outliers, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
  can improve outlier detection and robustness when compared with several popular
  alternatives like the student-t likelihood.
