abstract: 'Equivalence classes of DAGs (represented by CPDAGs) may be too large to
  provide useful causal information. Here, we address incorporating tiered background
  knowledge yielding restricted equivalence classes represented by ‘tiered MPDAGs’.
  Tiered knowledge leads to considerable gains in informativeness and computational
  efficiency: We show that construction of tiered MPDAGs only requires application
  of Meeks 1st rule, and that tiered MPDAGs (unlike general MPDAGs) are chain graphs
  with chordal components. This entails simplifications e.g. of determining valid
  adjustment sets for causal effect estimation. Further, we characterise when one
  tiered ordering is more informative than another, providing insights into useful
  aspects of background knowledge.'
