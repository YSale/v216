abstract: We investigate the problems of maximizing k-submodular functions over total
  size constraints and over individual size constraints. k-submodularity is a generalization
  of submodularity beyond just picking items of a ground set, instead associating
  one of k types to chosen items.  For sensor selection problems, for instance, this
  enables modeling of which type  of sensor to put at a location, not simply whether
  to put a sensor or not.   We propose and analyze threshold-greedy algorithms for
  both types of constraints.  We prove that our proposed algorithms achieve the best
  known approximation ratios for both constraint types, up to a user-chosen parameter
  that balances computational complexity and the approximation ratio, while only using
  a number of function evaluations that depends linearly (up to poly-logarithmic terms)
  on the number of elements n, the number of types k, and the inverse of the user
  chosen parameter.  Other algorithms that achieve the best-known deterministic approximation
  ratios require a number of  function evaluations that depends linearly on the budget
  B, while our methods do not.  We empirically demonstrate our algorithmsâ€™ performance
  in applications of sensor placement with k types and influence maximization with
  k topics.
