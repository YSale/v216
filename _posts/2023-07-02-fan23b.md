abstract: 'Data for pretraining machine learning models often consists of collections
  of heterogeneous datasets. Although training on their union is reasonable in agnostic
  settings, it might be suboptimal when the target domain —where the model will ultimately
  be used— is known in advance. In that case, one would ideally pretrain only on the
  dataset(s) most similar to the target one. Instead of limiting this choice to those
  datasets already present in the pretraining collection, here we explore extending
  this search to all datasets that can be synthesized as ‘combinations’ of them. We
  define such combinations as multi-dataset interpolations, formalized through the
  notion of generalized geodesics from optimal transport (OT) theory. We compute these
  geodesics using a recent notion of distance between labeled datasets, and derive
  alternative interpolation schemes based on it: using either barycentric projections
  or optimal transport maps, the latter computed using recent neural OT methods. These
  methods are scalable, efficient, and —notably— can be used to interpolate even between
  datasets with distinct and unrelated label sets. Through various experiments in
  transfer learning in computer vision, we demonstrate this is a promising new approach
  for targeted on-demand dataset synthesis.'
