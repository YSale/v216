abstract: 'This paper studies a cooperative multi-agent bandit scenario in which the
  rewards observed by agents are heterogeneous—one agent’s meat can be another agent’s
  poison. Specifically, the total reward observed by each agent is the sum of two
  values: an arm-specific reward, capturing the intrinsic value of the arm, and a
  privately-known agent-specific reward, which captures the personal preference/limitations
  of the agent. This heterogeneity in total reward leads to different local optimal
  arms for agents but creates an opportunity for \textit{free exploration} in a cooperative
  setting—an agent can freely explore its local optimal arm with no regret and share
  this free observation with some other agents who would suffer regrets if they pull
  this arm since the arm is not optimal for them. We first characterize a regret lower
  bound that captures free exploration, i.e., arms that can be freely explored have
  no contribution to the regret lower bound. Then, we present a cooperative bandit
  algorithm that takes advantage of free exploration and achieves a near-optimal regret
  upper bound which tightly matches the regret lower bound up to a constant factor.
  Lastly, we run numerical simulations to compare our algorithm with various baselines
  without free exploration.'
