abstract: We consider stochastic graphical bandits, where after pulling an arm, the
  decision maker observes rewards of not only the chosen arm but also its neighbors
  in a feedback graph. Most of existing work assumes that the rewards are drawn from
  bounded or at least sub-Gaussian distributions, which however may be violated in
  many practical scenarios such as social advertising and financial markets. To settle
  this issue, we investigate stochastic graphical bandits with heavy-tailed rewards,
  where the distributions have finite moments of order $1+\epsilon$, for some $\epsilon\in(0,
  1]$. Firstly, we develop one UCB-type algorithm, whose expected regret is upper
  bounded by a sum of gap-based quantities over the <em>clique covering</em> of the
  feedback graph. The key idea is to estimate the reward means of the selected armâ€™s
  neighbors by more refined robust estimators, and to construct a graph-based upper
  confidence bound for selecting candidates. Secondly, we design another elimination-based
  strategy and improve the regret bound to a gap-based sum with size controlled by
  the <em>independence number</em> of the feedback graph. For benign graphs, the <em>independence
  number</em> could be smaller than the size of the <em>clique covering</em>, resulting
  in tighter regret bounds. Finally, we conduct experiments on synthetic data to demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our methods.
