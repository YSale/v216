abstract: Visual object tracking has seen significant progress in recent years. However,
  the vast majority of this work focuses on tracking objects within the image plane
  of a single camera and ignores the uncertainty associated with predicted object
  locations. In this work, we focus on the geospatial object tracking problem using
  data from a distributed camera network. The goal is to predict an object’s track
  in geospatial coordinates along with uncertainty over the object’s location while
  respecting communication constraints that prohibit centralizing raw image data.
  We present a novel single-object geospatial tracking data set that includes high-accuracy
  ground truth object locations and video data from a network of four cameras. We
  present a modeling framework for addressing this task including a novel backbone
  model and explore how uncertainty calibration and fine-tuning through a differentiable
  tracker affect performance.
