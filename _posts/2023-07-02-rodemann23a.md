abstract: 'Semi-supervised learning by self-training heavily relies on pseudo-label
  selection (PLS). This selection often depends on the initial model fit on labeled
  data. Early overfitting might thus be propagated to the final model by selecting
  instances with overconfident but erroneous predictions, often referred to as confirmation
  bias. This paper introduces BPLS, a Bayesian framework for PLS that aims to mitigate
  this issue. At its core lies a criterion for selecting instances to label: an analytical
  approximation of the posterior predictive of pseudo-samples. We derive this selection
  criterion by proving Bayes-optimality of the posterior predictive of pseudo-samples.
  We further overcome computational hurdles by approximating the criterion analytically.
  Its relation to the marginal likelihood allows us to come up with an approximation
  based on Laplaceâ€™s method and the Gaussian integral. We empirically assess BPLS
  on simulated and real-world data. When faced with high-dimensional data prone to
  overfitting, BPLS outperforms traditional PLS methods.'
