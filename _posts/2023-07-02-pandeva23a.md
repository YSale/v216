abstract: Independent component analysis (ICA) is a blind source separation method
  for linear disentanglement of independent latent sources from observed data. We
  investigate the special setting of noisy linear ICA, referred to as ShIndICA,  where
  the observations are split among different views, each receiving a mixture of shared
  and individual sources. We prove that the corresponding linear structure is identifiable
  and the sources distribution can be recovered. To computationally estimate the sources,
  we optimize a constrained form of the joint log-likelihood of the observed data
  among all views. Furthermore, we propose a model selection procedure for recovering
  the number of shared sources. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the advantages
  of our model over baselines. We apply  ShIndICA in a challenging real-life task,
  using three transcriptome datasets provided by three different labs (three different
  views). The recovered sources were used for a downstream graph inference task, facilitating
  the discovery of a plausible representation of the data’s underlying graph structure.
