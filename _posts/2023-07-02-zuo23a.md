abstract: The utilization of online optimization techniques is prevalent in many fields
  of artificial intelligence, enabling systems to continuously learn and adjust to
  their surroundings. This paper outlines a regularized online optimization problem,
  where the regularizer is defined on the average of the actions taken. The objective
  is to maximize  the sum of rewards and the regularizer value while adhering to resource
  constraints, where the reward function is assumed to be DR-submodular. Both concave
  and DR-submodular regularizers are analyzed. Concave functions are useful in describing
  the impartiality of decisions, while DR-submodular functions can be employed to
  represent the overall effect of decisions on all relevant parties. We have developed
  two algorithms for each of the concave and DR-submodular regularizers. These algorithms
  are easy to implement, efficient, and produce sublinear regret in both cases. The
  performance of the proposed algorithms and regularizers has been verified through
  numerical experiments in the context of internet advertising.
