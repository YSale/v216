abstract: Causal sufficiency is a cornerstone assumption in causal discovery. It is,
  however, both unlikely to hold in practice as well as unverifiable. When it does
  not hold, existing methods struggle to return meaningful results. In this paper,
  we show how to discover the causal network over both observed and unobserved variables.
  Moreover, we show that the causal model is identifiable in the sparse linear Gaussian
  case. More generally, we extend the algorithmic Markov condition to include latent
  confounders. We propose a consistent score based on the Minimum Description Length
  principle to discover the full causal network, including latent confounders. Based
  on this score, we develop an effective algorithm that finds those sets of nodes
  for which the addition of a confounding factor $Z$ is most beneficial, then fits
  a new causal network over both observed as well as inferred latent variables.
