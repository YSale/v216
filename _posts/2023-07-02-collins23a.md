abstract: 'Aligning model representations to humans has been found to improve robustness
  and generalization. However, such methods often focus on standard observational
  data. Synthetic data is proliferating and powering many advances in machine learning;
  yet, it is not always clear whether synthetic labels are perceptually aligned to
  humans â€“ rendering it likely model representations are not human aligned. We focus
  on the synthetic data used in mixup: a powerful regularizer shown to improve model
  robustness, generalization, and calibration. We design a comprehensive series of
  elicitation interfaces, which we release as HILL MixE Suite, and recruit 159 participants
  to provide perceptual judgments along with their uncertainties, over mixup examples.
  We find that human perceptions do not consistently align with the labels traditionally
  used for synthetic points, and begin to demonstrate the applicability of these findings
  to potentially increase the reliability of downstream models, particularly when
  incorporating human uncertainty. We release all elicited judgments in a new data
  hub we call H-Mix.'
