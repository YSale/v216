abstract: In real-world applications, handling partial observability is a common requirement
  for reinforcement learning algorithms, which is not captured by a Markov decision
  process (MDP). Although partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs)
  have been specifically designed to address this requirement, they present significant
  computational and statistical challenges in learning and planning. In this work,
  we introduce the <em>Energy-based Predictive Representation (EPR)</em> to provide
  a unified approach for designing practical reinforcement learning algorithms in
  both the MDP and POMDP settings. This framework enables coherent handling of <em>learning,
  exploration, and planning</em> tasks. The proposed framework leverages a powerful
  neural energy-based model to extract an adequate representation, allowing for efficient
  approximation of Q-functions. This representation facilitates the efficient computation
  of confidence, enabling the implementation of optimism or pessimism in planning
  when faced with uncertainty. Consequently, it effectively manages the trade-off
  between exploration and exploitation. Experimental investigations demonstrate that
  the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in both MDP and POMDP
  settings.
