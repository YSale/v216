abstract: Entity linking, bridging mentions in the contexts with their corresponding
  entities in the knowledge bases, has attracted wide attention due to many potential
  applications. Recently, plenty of multimodal entity linking approaches have been
  proposed to take full advantage of the visual information rather than solely the
  textual modality. Although feasible, these methods mainly focus on the single-mention
  scenarios and neglect the scenarios where multiple mentions exist simultaneously
  in the same context, which limits the performance. In fact, such multi-mention scenarios
  are pretty common in public datasets and real-world applications. To solve this
  challenge, we first propose a joint feature extraction module to learn the representations
  of context and entity candidates, from both the visual and textual perspectives.
  Then, we design a pairwise training scheme (for training) and a multi-mention collaborative
  ranking method (for testing) to model the potential connections between different
  mentions. We evaluate our method on a public dataset and a self-constructed dataset,
  NYTimes-MEL, under both text-only and multimodal scenarios. The experimental results
  demonstrate that our method can largely outperform the state-of-the-art methods,
  especially in multi-mention scenarios. Our dataset and source code are publicly
  available at https://github.com/ycm094/MMEL-main.
