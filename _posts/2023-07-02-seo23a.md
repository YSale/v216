abstract: One of the major challenges in multi-person pose estimation is instance-aware
  keypoint estimation. Previous methods address this problem by leveraging an off-the-shelf
  detector, heuristic post-grouping process or explicit instance identification process,
  hindering further improvements in the inference speed which is an important factor
  for practical applications. From the statistical point of view, those additional
  processes for identifying instances are necessary to bypass learning the high-dimensional
  joint distribution of human keypoints, which is a critical factor for another major
  challenge, the occlusion scenario. In this work, we propose a novel framework of
  single-stage instance-aware pose estimation by modeling the joint distribution of
  human keypoints with a mixture density model, termed as MDPose. Our MDPose estimates
  the distribution of human keypointsâ€™ coordinates using a mixture density model with
  an instance-aware keypoint head consisting simply of 8 convolutional layers. It
  is trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the ground truth keypoints.
  Also, we propose a simple yet effective training strategy, Random Keypoint Grouping
  (RKG), which significantly alleviates the underflow problem leading to successful
  learning of relations between keypoints. On OCHuman dataset, which consists of images
  with highly occluded people, our MDPose achieves state-of-the-art performance by
  successfully learning the high-dimensional joint distribution of human keypoints.
  Furthermore, our MDPose shows significant improvement in inference speed with a
  competitive accuracy on MS COCO, a widely-used human keypoint dataset, thanks to
  the proposed much simpler single-stage pipeline.
