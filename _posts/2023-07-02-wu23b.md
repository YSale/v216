abstract: Recently, there has been remarkable progress in reinforcement learning (RL)
  with general function approximation. However, all these works only provide regret
  or sample complexity guarantees. It is still an open question if one can achieve
  stronger performance guarantees, i.e., the uniform probably approximate correctness
  (Uniform-PAC) guarantee that can imply both a sub-linear regret bound and a polynomial
  sample complexity for any target learning accuracy.  We study this problem by proposing
  algorithms for both nonlinear bandits and model-based episodic RL using the general
  function class with a bounded eluder dimension. The key idea of the proposed algorithms
  is to assign each action to different levels according to its width with respect
  to the confidence set. The achieved Uniform-PAC sample complexity is tight in the
  sense that it matches the state-of-the-art regret bounds or sample complexity guarantees
  when reduced to the linear case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
  work for Uniform-PAC guarantees on bandit and RL that goes beyond linear cases.
