abstract: Spaces with locally varying scale of measurement, like multidimensional
  structures with differently scaled dimensions, are pretty common in statistics and
  machine learning. Nevertheless, it is still understood as an open question how to
  exploit the entire information encoded in them properly. We address this problem
  by considering an order based on (sets of) expectations of random variables mapping
  into such non-standard spaces. This order contains stochastic dominance and expectation
  order as extreme cases when no, or respectively perfect, cardinal structure is given.  We
  derive a (regularized) statistical test for our proposed generalized stochastic
  dominance (GSD) order, operationalize it by linear optimization, and robustify it
  by imprecise probability models. Our findings are illustrated with data from multidimensional
  poverty measurement, finance, and medicine.
