abstract: We present a novel approach for detecting soldering defects in Printed Circuit
  Boards (PCBs) composed mainly of Surface Mount Technology (SMT) components, using
  advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques. The main challenge addressed
  is the detection of soldering defects in new components for which only samples of
  good soldering are available at the model training phase. To address this, we design
  a system composed of generative and discriminative models to leverage the knowledge
  gained from the soldering samples of old components to detect the soldering defects
  of new components. To meet industrial quality standards, we keep the leakage rate
  (i.e., miss detection rate) low by making the system "unknown-aware" with a low
  unknown rate. We evaluated the method on a real-world dataset from an electronics
  company. It significantly reduces the leakage rate from 1.827% $\pm$ 3.063% and
  1.942% $\pm$ 1.337% to 0.063% $\pm$ 0.075% with an unknown rate of 3.706% $\pm$
  2.270% compared to the discriminative and generative approaches, respectively.
