abstract: We present the first systematic study of effectiveness of robustness transformations
  on a diverse set of 24 probabilistic programs representing generalized linear models,
  mixture models, and time-series models. We evaluate five robustness transformations
  from literature on each model. We quantify and present insights on (1) the improvement
  of the posterior prediction accuracy and (2) the execution time overhead of the
  robustified programs, in the presence of three input noise models.  To automate
  the evaluation of various robustness transformations, we developed ASTRA - a novel
  framework for quantifying the robustness of probabilistic programs and exploring
  the trade-offs between robustness and execution time. Our experimental results indicate
  that the existing transformations are often suitable only for specific noise models,
  can significantly increase execution time, and have non-trivial interaction with
  the inference algorithms.
