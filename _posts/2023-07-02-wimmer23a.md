abstract: The quantification of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in terms of conditional
  entropy and mutual information, respectively, has recently become quite common in
  machine learning. While the properties of these measures, which are rooted in information
  theory, seem appealing at first glance, we identify various incoherencies that call
  their appropriateness into question. In addition to the measures themselves, we
  critically discuss the idea of an additive decomposition of total uncertainty into
  its aleatoric and epistemic constituents. Experiments across different computer
  vision tasks support our theoretical findings and raise concerns about current practice
  in uncertainty quantification.
