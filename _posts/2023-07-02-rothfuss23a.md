abstract: We study the problem of conservative off-policy evaluation (COPE) where
  given an offline dataset of environment interactions, collected by other agents,
  we seek to obtain a (tight) lower bound on a policy’s performance. This is crucial
  when deciding whether a given policy satisfies certain minimal performance/safety
  criteria before it can be deployed in the real world. To this end, we introduce
  HAMBO, which builds on an uncertainty-aware learned model of the transition dynamics.
  To form a conservative estimate of the policy’s performance, HAMBO hallucinates
  worst-case trajectories that the policy may take, within the margin of the models’
  epistemic confidence regions. We prove that the resulting COPE estimates are valid
  lower bounds, and, under regularity conditions, show their convergence to the true
  expected return. Finally, we discuss scalable variants of our approach based on
  Bayesian Neural Networks and empirically demonstrate that they yield reliable and
  tight lower bounds in various continuous control environments.
