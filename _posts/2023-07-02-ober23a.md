abstract: Deep kernel processes are a recently introduced class of deep Bayesian models
  that have the flexibility of neural networks, but work entirely with Gram matrices.
  They operate by alternately sampling a Gram matrix from a distribution over positive
  semi-definite matrices, and applying a deterministic transformation. When the distribution
  is chosen to be Wishart, the model is called a deep Wishart process (DWP). This
  particular model is of interest because its prior is equivalent to a deep Gaussian
  process (DGP) prior, but at the same time it is invariant to rotational symmetries,
  leading to a simpler posterior distribution. Practical inference in the DWP was
  made possible in recent work (“A variational approximate posterior for the deep
  Wishart process” Ober and Aitchison, 2021a) where the authors used a generalisation
  of the Bartlett decomposition of the Wishart distribution as the variational approximate
  posterior. However, predictive performance in that paper was less impressive than
  one might expect, with the DWP only beating a DGP on a few of the UCI datasets used
  for comparison. In this paper, we show that further generalising their distribution
  to allow linear combinations of rows and columns in the Bartlett decomposition results
  in better predictive performance, while incurring negligible additional computation
  cost.
