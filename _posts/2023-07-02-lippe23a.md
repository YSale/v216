abstract: Identifying the causal variables of an environment and how to intervene
  on them is of core value in applications such as robotics and embodied AI. While
  an agent can commonly interact with the environment and may implicitly perturb the
  behavior of some of these causal variables, often the targets it affects remain
  unknown. In this paper, we show that causal variables can still be identified for
  many common setups, e.g., additive Gaussian noise models, if the agent’s interactions
  with a causal variable can be described by an unknown binary variable. This happens
  when each causal variable has two different mechanisms, e.g., an observational and
  an interventional one. Using this identifiability result, we propose BISCUIT, a
  method for simultaneously learning causal variables and their corresponding binary
  interaction variables. On three robotic-inspired datasets, BISCUIT accurately identifies
  causal variables and can even be scaled to complex, realistic environments for embodied
  AI.
