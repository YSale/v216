abstract: Neural-symbolic AI (NeSy) allows neural networks to exploit symbolic background
  knowledge in the form of logic. It has been shown to aid learning in the limited
  data regime and to facilitate inference on out-of-distribution data. Probabilistic
  NeSy focuses on integrating neural networks with both logic and probability theory,
  which additionally allows learning under uncertainty. A major limitation of current
  probabilistic NeSy systems, such as DeepProbLog, is their restriction to finite
  probability distributions, i.e., discrete random variables. In contrast, deep probabilistic
  programming (DPP) excels in modelling and optimising continuous probability distributions.
  Hence, we introduce DeepSeaProbLog, a neural probabilistic logic programming language
  that incorporates DPP techniques into NeSy. Doing so results in the support of inference
  and learning of both discrete and continuous probability distributions under logical
  constraints. Our main contributions are 1) the semantics of DeepSeaProbLog and its
  corresponding inference algorithm, 2) a proven asymptotically unbiased learning
  algorithm, and 3) a series of experiments that illustrate the versatility of our
  approach.
