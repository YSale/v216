abstract: Causal discovery from time series data is a typical problem setting across
  the sciences. Often, multiple datasets of the same system variables are available,
  for instance, time series of river runoff from different catchments. The local catchment
  systems then share certain causal parents, such as time-dependent large-scale weather
  over all catchments, but differ in other catchment-specific drivers, such as the
  altitude of the catchment. These drivers can be called temporal and spatial contexts,
  respectively, and are often partially unobserved. Pooling the datasets and considering
  the joint causal graph among system, context, and certain auxiliary variables enables
  us to overcome such latent confounding of system variables. In this work, we present
  a non-parametric time series causal discovery method, <em>J(oint)-PCMCI$^+$</em>,
  that efficiently learns such joint causal time series graphs when both observed
  and latent contexts are present, including time lags. We present asymptotic consistency
  results and numerical experiments demonstrating the utility and limitations of the
  method.
