abstract: It is a remarkable fact that the same $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret rate can be achieved
  in both the Experts Problem and the Adversarial Multi-Armed Bandit problem albeit
  with a worse dependence on number of actions in the latter case. In contrast, it
  has been shown that handling online MDPs with communicating structure and bandit
  information incurs $\Omega(T^{2/3})$ regret even in the case of deterministic transitions.
  Is this the price we pay for handling communicating structure or is it because we
  also have bandit feedback? In this paper we show that with full information, online
  MDPs can still be learned at an $O(\sqrt{T})$ rate even in the presence of communicating
  structure. We first show this by proposing an efficient follow the perturbed leader
  (FPL) algorithm for the deterministic transition case. We then extend our scope
  to consider stochastic transitions where we first give an inefficient $O(\sqrt{T})$-regret
  algorithm (with a mild additional condition on the dynamics). Then we show how to
  achieve $O\left(\sqrt{\frac{T}{\alpha}}\right)$ regret rate using an oracle-efficient
  algorithm but with the additional restriction that the starting state distribution
  has mass at least $\alpha$ on each state.
