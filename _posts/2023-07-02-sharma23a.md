abstract: Computational efficiency is a major bottleneck in using classic graph-based
  approaches for semi-supervised learning on datasets with a large number of unlabeled
  examples. Known techniques to improve efficiency typically involve an approximation
  of the graph regularization objective, but suffer two major drawbacks - first the
  graph is assumed to be known or constructed with heuristic hyperparameter values,
  second they do not provide a principled approximation guarantee for learning over
  the full unlabeled dataset. Building on recent work on learning graphs for semi-supervised
  learning from multiple datasets for problems from the same domain, and leveraging
  techniques for fast approximations for solving linear systems in the graph Laplacian
  matrix, we propose algorithms that overcome both the above limitations.  We show
  a formal separation in the learning-theoretic complexity of sparse and dense graph
  families. We further show how to approximately learn the best graphs from the sparse
  families efficiently using the conjugate gradient method. Our approach can also
  be used to learn the graph efficiently online with sub-linear regret, under mild
  smoothness assumptions. Our online learning results are stated generally, and may
  be useful for approximate and efficient parameter tuning in other problems. We implement
  our approach and demonstrate significant ($\sim$10-100x) speedups over prior work
  on semi-supervised learning with learned graphs on benchmark datasets.
