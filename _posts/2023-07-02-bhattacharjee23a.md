abstract: We consider the Best Arm Identification (BAI) problem in the stochastic
  multi-armed bandit framework, where each arm has a small probability of realizing
  large rewards, while with overwhelming probability, the reward is zero. A key application
  of this framework is in online advertising, where click rates of advertisements
  could be a fraction of a single percent and final conversion to sales, while highly
  profitable, may again be a small fraction of the click rates. Lately, algorithms
  for BAI problems have been developed that minimise sample complexity while providing
  statistical guarantees on the correct arm selection. As we observe, these algorithms
  can be computationally prohibitive. We exploit the fact that the reward process
  for each arm is well approximated by a Compound Poisson process and arrive at algorithms
  that are faster, with a small increase in sample complexity. We analyze the problem
  in an asymptotic regime as rarity of reward occurrence reduces to zero, and reward
  amounts increase to infinity. This helps illustrate the benefits of the proposed
  algorithm. It also sheds light on the underlying structure of the optimal BAI algorithms
  in the rare event setting.
