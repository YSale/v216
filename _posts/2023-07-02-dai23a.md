abstract: 'In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient balancing has recently attracted
  more research interest than loss balancing since it often leads to better performance.
  However, loss balancing is much more efficient than gradient balancing, and thus
  it is still worth further exploration in MTL. Note that prior studies typically
  ignore that there exist varying improvable gaps across multiple tasks, where the
  improvable gap per task is defined as the distance between the current training
  progress and desired final training progress. Therefore, after loss balancing, the
  performance imbalance still arises in many cases. In this paper, following the loss
  balancing framework, we propose two novel improvable gap balancing (IGB) algorithms
  for MTL: one takes a simple heuristic, and the other (for the first time) deploys
  deep reinforcement learning for MTL. Particularly, instead of directly balancing
  the losses in MTL, both algorithms choose to dynamically assign task weights for
  improvable gap balancing. Moreover, we combine IGB and gradient balancing to show
  the complementarity between the two types of algorithms. Extensive experiments on
  two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our IGB algorithms lead to the best results
  in MTL via loss balancing and achieve further improvements when combined with gradient
  balancing. Code is available at https://github.com/YanqiDai/IGB4MTL.'
