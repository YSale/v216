abstract: Marked temporal point processes (MTPPs) are a general class of stochastic
  models for modeling the evolution of events of different types (“marks”) in continuous
  time. These models have broad applications in areas such as medical data monitoring,
  financial prediction, user modeling, and communication networks. Of significant
  practical interest in such problems is the issue of missing or censored data over
  time. In this paper, we focus on the specific problem of inference for a trained
  MTPP model when events of certain types are not observed over a period of time during
  prediction. We introduce the concept of mark-censored sub-processes and use this
  framework to develop a novel marginalization technique for inference in the presence
  of censored marks. The approach is model-agnostic and applicable to any MTPP model
  with a well-defined intensity function. We illustrate the flexibility and utility
  of the method in the context of both parametric and neural MTPP models, with results
  across a range of datasets including data from simulated Hawkes processes, self-correcting
  processes, and multiple real-world event datasets.
