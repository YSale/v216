abstract: 'A survival dataset describes a set of instances (e.g. patients) and provides,
  for each, either the time until an event (e.g. death), or the censoring time (e.g.
  when lost to follow-up - which is a lower bound on the time until the event). We
  consider the challenge of survival prediction: learning, from such data, a predictive
  model that can produce an individual survival distribution for a novel instance.
  Many contemporary methods of survival prediction implicitly assume that the event
  and censoring distributions are independent conditional on the instanceâ€™s covariates
  - a strong assumption that is difficult to verify (as we observe only one outcome
  for each instance) and which can induce significant bias when it does not hold.
  This paper presents a parametric model of survival that extends modern non-linear
  survival analysis by relaxing the assumption of conditional independence. On synthetic
  and semi-synthetic data, our approach significantly improves estimates of survival
  distributions compared to the standard that assumes conditional independence in
  the data.'
