abstract: Many real-world systems such as e-commerce websites and content-serving
  platforms employ two-stage recommendation — in the first stage, multiple nominators
  (experts) provide ranked lists of items (one nominator per category, e.g., sports
  and political news articles), and in the second stage, an aggregator filters across
  the lists and outputs a single (short) list of K items to the users. The aggregation
  stage can be posed as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem, with the additional
  structure that the arms are grouped into categories (disjoint sets of items) and
  the ranking of arms within each category is known. We propose algorithms for selecting
  top K items in this setting under two learning objectives, namely minimizing regret
  over rounds and identifying the top K items within a fixed number of rounds. For
  each of the objectives, we provide sharp regret/error analysis using carefully defined
  notion of “gap” that exploits our problem structure. The resulting regret/error
  bounds strictly improve over prior work in combinatorial bandits literature. We
  also provide supporting evidence from simulations on synthetic and semi-synthetic
  problems.
