abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a framework to quantify uncertainty of machine
  learning classifiers including deep neural networks. Given a testing example and
  a trained classifier, CP produces a prediction set of candidate labels with a user-specified  coverage
  (i.e., true class label is contained with high probability). Almost all the existing
  work on CP assumes clean testing data and there is not much known about the robustness
  of CP algorithms w.r.t natural/adversarial perturbations to testing examples. This
  paper studies the problem of probabilistically robust conformal prediction (PRCP)
  which ensures robustness to most perturbations around clean input examples. PRCP
  generalizes the standard CP (cannot handle perturbations) and adversarially robust
  CP (ensures robustness w.r.t worst-case perturbations) to achieve better trade-offs
  between nominal performance and robustness.  We propose a novel adaptive PRCP (aPRCP)
  algorithm to achieve probabilistically robust coverage. The key idea behind aPRCP
  is to determine two parallel thresholds, one for data samples and another one for
  the perturbations on data (aka "quantile-of-quantile‚Äù design). We provide theoretical
  analysis to show that aPRCP algorithm achieves robust coverage. Our experiments
  on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets using deep neural networks demonstrate
  that aPRCP achieves better trade-offs than state-of-the-art CP and adversarially
  robust CP algorithms.
