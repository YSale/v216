abstract: The evolution of many dynamical systems is generically governed by nonlinear
  partial differential equations (PDEs), whose solution, in a simulation framework,
  requires vast amounts of computational resources. In this work, we present a novel
  method that combines a hyper-network solver with a Fourier Neural Operator architecture.
  Our method treats time and space separately and as a result, it successfully propagates
  initial conditions in continuous time steps by employing the general composition
  properties of the partial differential operators. Following previous works, supervision
  is provided at a specific time point. We test our method on various time evolution
  PDEs, including nonlinear fluid flows in one, two, or three spatial dimensions.
  The results show that the new method improves the learning accuracy at the time
  of the supervision point, and can interpolate the solutions to any intermediate
  time.
