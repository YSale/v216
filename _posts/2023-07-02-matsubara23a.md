abstract: This paper proposes a new metric to measure the calibration error of probabilistic
  binary classifiers, called test-based calibration error (TCE). TCE incorporates
  a novel loss function based on a statistical test to examine the extent to which
  model predictions differ from probabilities estimated from data. It offers (i) a
  clear interpretation, (ii) a consistent scale that is unaffected by class imbalance,
  and (iii) an enhanced visual representation with respect to the standard reliability
  diagram. In addition, we introduce an optimality criterion for the binning procedure
  of calibration error metrics based on a minimal estimation error of the empirical
  probabilities. We provide a novel computational algorithm for optimal bins under
  bin-size constraints. We demonstrate properties of TCE through a range of experiments,
  including multiple real-world imbalanced datasets and ImageNet 1000.
