abstract: Modern reinforcement learning systems produce many high-quality policies
  throughout the learning process. However, to choose which policy to actually deploy
  in the real world, they must be tested under an intractable number of environmental
  conditions. We introduce RPOSST, an algorithm to select a small set of test cases
  from a larger pool based on a relatively small number of sample evaluations. RPOSST
  treats the test case selection problem as a two-player game and optimizes a solution
  with provable $k$-of-$N$ robustness, bounding the error relative to a test that
  used all the test cases in the pool. Empirical results demonstrate that RPOSST finds
  a small set of test cases that identify high quality policies in a toy one-shot
  game, poker datasets, and a high-fidelity racing simulator.
