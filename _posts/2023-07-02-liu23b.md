abstract: Neural networks are universal approximators and are studied for their use
  in solving differential equations.  However, a major criticism is the lack of error
  bounds for obtained solutions.  This paper proposes a technique to rigorously evaluate
  the error bound of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) on most linear ordinary
  differential equations (ODEs), certain nonlinear ODEs, and first-order linear partial
  differential equations (PDEs).  The error bound is based purely on equation structure
  and residual information and does not depend on assumptions of how well the networks
  are trained.  We propose algorithms that bound the error efficiently. Some proposed
  algorithms provide tighter bounds than others at the cost of longer run time.
