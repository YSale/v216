abstract: Probabilistic user modeling is essential for building machine learning systems
  in the ubiquitous cases with humans in the loop. However, modern advanced user models,
  often designed as cognitive behavior simulators, are incompatible with modern machine
  learning pipelines and computationally prohibitive for most practical applications.
  We address this problem by introducing widely-applicable differentiable surrogates
  for bypassing this computational bottleneck; the surrogates enable computationally
  efficient inference with modern cognitive models. We show experimentally that modeling
  capabilities comparable to the only available solution, existing likelihood-free
  inference methods, are achievable with a computational cost suitable for online
  applications. Finally, we demonstrate how AI-assistants can now use cognitive models
  for online interaction in a menu-search task, which has so far required hours of
  computation during interaction.
