abstract: Inferring causal effects of continuous-valued treatments from observational
  data is a crucial task promising to better inform policy- and decision-makers. A
  critical assumption needed to identify these effects is that all confounding variables—causal
  parents of both the treatment and the outcome—are included as covariates. Unfortunately,
  given observational data alone, we cannot know with certainty that this criterion
  is satisfied. Sensitivity analyses provide principled ways to give bounds on causal
  estimates when confounding variables are hidden. While much attention is focused
  on sensitivity analyses for discrete-valued treatments, much less is paid to continuous-valued
  treatments. We present novel methodology to bound both average and conditional average
  continuous-valued treatment-effect estimates when they cannot be point identified
  due to hidden confounding. A semi-synthetic benchmark on multiple datasets shows
  our method giving tighter coverage of the true dose-response curve than a recently
  proposed continuous sensitivity model and baselines. Finally, we apply our method
  to a real-world observational case study to demonstrate the value of identifying
  dose-dependent causal effects.
