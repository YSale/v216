abstract: Machine learning algorithms are often repeatedly. applied to problems with
  similar structure over and over again. We focus on solving a sequence of bandit
  optimization tasks and develop LIBO, an algorithm which adapts to the environment
  by learning from past experience and becomes more sample-efficient in the process.
  We assume a kernelized structure where the kernel is unknown but shared across all
  tasks. LIBO sequentially meta-learns a kernel that approximates the true kernel
  and solves the incoming tasks with the latest kernel estimate. Our algorithm can
  be paired with any kernelized or linear bandit algorithm and guarantees oracle optimal
  performance, meaning that as more tasks are solved, the regret of LIBO on each task
  converges to the regret of the bandit algorithm with oracle knowledge of the true
  kernel. Naturally, if paired with a sublinear bandit algorithm, LIBO yields a sublinear
  lifelong regret. We also show that direct access to the data from each task is not
  necessary for attaining sublinear regret. We propose F-LIBO, which solves the lifelong
  problem in a federated manner.
