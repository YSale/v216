abstract: 'Diffusion Schrödinger bridges (DSBs) have recently emerged as a powerful
  framework for recovering stochastic dynamics via their marginal observations at
  different time points. Despite numerous successful applications, existing algorithms
  for solving DSBs have so far failed to utilize the structure of aligned data, which
  naturally arises in many biological phenomena. In this paper, we propose a novel
  algorithmic framework that, for the first time, solves DSBs while respecting the
  data alignment. Our approach hinges on a combination of two decades-old ideas: The
  classical Schrödinger bridge theory and Doob’s $h$-transform. Compared to prior
  methods, our approach leads to a simpler training procedure with lower variance,
  which we further augment with principled regularization schemes. This ultimately
  leads to sizeable improvements across experiments on synthetic and real data, including
  the tasks of predicting conformational changes in proteins and temporal evolution
  of cellular differentiation processes.'
