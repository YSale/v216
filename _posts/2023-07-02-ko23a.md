abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is an effective method for discovering
  meaningful patterns in graph data. By evaluating diverse augmentations of the graph,
  GCL learns discriminative representations and provides a flexible and scalable mechanism
  for various graph mining tasks. This paper proposes a novel contrastive learning
  framework by introducing Laplacian perturbation. The proposed framework offers a
  distinct advantage by employing an indirect perturbation method, which provides
  a more stable approach while maintaining the perturbation effects. Moreover, it
  exhibits a wide range of applicability by not being restricted to specific graph
  types. We demonstrate that a spectral graph convolution based on the Laplacian successfully
  extracts representations from diverse graph types. Our extensive experiments on
  a variety of real-world datasets, covering multiple graph types, show that the proposed
  model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both node classification and link
  sign prediction tasks.
