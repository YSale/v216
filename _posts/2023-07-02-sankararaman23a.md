abstract: We study algorithms for online  change-point detection (OCPD), where samples
  that are potentially heavy-tailed, are presented one at a time and a change in the
  underlying mean must be detected as early as possible. We present an algorithm based
  on clipped Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), that works even if we only assume
  that the second moment of the data generating process is bounded. We derive guarantees
  on worst-case, finite-sample false-positive rate (FPR) over the family of all distributions
  with bounded second moment. Thus, our method is the first OCPD algorithm that guarantees
  finite-sample FPR, even if the data is high dimensional and  the underlying distributions
  are heavy-tailed. The technical contribution of our paper is to show that clipped-SGD
  can estimate the mean of a random vector and simultaneously provide confidence bounds
  at all confidence values. We combine this robust estimate with a union bound argument
  and construct a sequential change-point algorithm with finite-sample FPR guarantees.
  We show empirically that our algorithm works well in a variety of situations, whether
  the underlying data are heavy-tailed, light-tailed, high dimensional or discrete.
  No other algorithm achieves bounded FPR theoretically or empirically, over all settings
  we study simultaneously.
