abstract: 'Diffusion auction refers to an emerging paradigm of online marketplace
  where an auctioneer utilises a social network to attract potential buyers.  Diffusion
  auction poses significant privacy risks. From the auction outcome, it is possible
  to infer hidden, and potentially sensitive, preferences of buyers. To mitigate such
  risks, we initiate the study of differential privacy (DP) in diffusion auction mechanisms.
  DP is a well-established notion of privacy that protects a system against inference
  attacks. Achieving DP in diffusion auctions is non-trivial as the well-designed
  auction rules are required to incentivise the buyers to truthfully report their
  neighbourhood. We study the single-unit case and design two differentially private
  diffusion mechanisms (DPDMs): recursive DPDM and layered DPDM. We prove that these
  mechanisms guarantee differential privacy, incentive compatibility and individual
  rationality for both valuations and neighbourhood. We then empirically compare their
  performance on real and synthetic datasets.'
