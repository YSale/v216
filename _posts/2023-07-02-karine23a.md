abstract: Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) are a class of personalized
  health interventions developed within the behavioral science community. JITAIs aim
  to provide the right type and amount of support by iteratively selecting a sequence
  of intervention options from a pre-defined set of components in response to each
  individualâ€™s time varying state. In this work, we explore the application of reinforcement
  learning methods to the problem of learning intervention option selection policies.
  We study the effect of context inference error and partial observability on the
  ability to learn effective policies. Our results show that the propagation of uncertainty
  from context inferences is critical to improving intervention efficacy as context
  uncertainty increases, while policy gradient algorithms can provide remarkable robustness
  to partially observed behavioral state information.
