abstract: Sparse graphs built by sparse representation has been demonstrated to be
  effective in clustering high-dimensional data. Albeit the compelling empirical performance,
  the vanilla sparse graph ignores the geometric information of the data by performing
  sparse representation for each datum separately. In order to obtain a sparse graph
  aligned with the local geometric structure of data, we propose a novel Support Regularized
  Sparse Graph, abbreviated as SRSG, for data clustering. SRSG encourages local smoothness
  on the neighborhoods of nearby data points by a well-defined support regularization
  term. We propose a fast proximal gradient descent method to solve the non-convex
  optimization problem of SRSG with the convergence matching the Nesterovâ€™s optimal
  convergence rate of first-order methods on smooth and convex objective function
  with Lipschitz continuous gradient. Extensive experimental results on various real
  data sets demonstrate the superiority of SRSG over other competing clustering methods.
