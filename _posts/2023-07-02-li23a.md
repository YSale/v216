abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is a binary classification that detects anomalies
  in unseen samples given only unlabeled normal data. Reconstruction-based approaches
  are widely used, which perform reconstruction error minimization on training data
  to learn normal patterns and quantify the degree of anomalies by reconstruction
  errors on testing data. However, this approach tends to miss anomalies when the
  normal data has multi-pattern. Because the model generalizes unrestrictedly beyond
  normal patterns even to include anomaly patterns. In this paper, we proposed a memory
  mechanism that memorizes typical normal patterns through a capacity-controlled external
  differentiable matrix so that the generalization of the model to anomalies is limited
  by the retrieval of the matrix. We achieved state-of-the-art performance on several
  public benchmarks.
