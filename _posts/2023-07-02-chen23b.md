abstract: Benign overfitting, where classifiers memorize noisy training data yet still
  achieve a good generalization performance, has drawn great attention in the machine
  learning community. To explain this surprising phenomenon, a series of works have
  provided theoretical justification for over-parameterized linear regression, classification,
  and kernel methods. However, it is not clear if benign overfitting can occur in
  the presence of adversarial examples, i.e., examples with tiny and intentional perturbations
  to fool the classifiers. In this paper, we show that benign overfitting indeed occurs
  in adversarial training, a principled approach to defend against adversarial examples,
  on subGaussian mixture data. In detail, we prove the risk bounds of the adversarially
  trained linear classifier on the mixture of sub-Gaussian data under Lp adversarial
  perturbations. Our result suggests that under moderate perturbations, adversarially
  trained linear classifiers can achieve the near-optimal standard and adversarial
  risks, despite overfitting the noisy training data. Numerical experiments validate
  our theoretical findings.
