abstract: In the emerging paradigm of Federated Learning (FL), large amount of clients
  such as mobile devices are used to train possibly high-dimensional models on their
  respective data. Combining (dimension-wise) adaptive gradient methods (e.g., Adam,
  AMSGrad) with FL has been an active direction, which is shown to outperform traditional
  SGD based FL in many cases. In this paper, we focus on the problem of training federated
  deep neural networks, and propose a novel FL framework which further introduces
  layer-wise adaptivity to the local model updates to accelerate the convergence of
  adaptive FL methods. Our framework includes two variants based on two recent locally
  adaptive federated learning algorithms. Theoretically, we provide a convergence
  analysis of our layer-wise FL methods, coined Fed-LAMB and Mime-LAMB, which match
  the convergence rate of state-of-the-art results in adaptive FL and exhibits linear
  speedup in terms of the number of workers. Experimental results on various datasets
  and models, under both IID and non-IID local data settings, show that both Fed-LAMB
  and Mime-LAMB achieve faster convergence speed and better generalization performance,
  compared to various recent adaptive FL methods.
