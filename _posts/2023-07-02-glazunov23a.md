abstract: 'Detection of the outliers is pivotal for any machine learning model deployed
  and operated in real-world. It is essential for the Deep Neural Networks that were
  shown to be overconfident with such inputs. Moreover, even deep generative models
  that allow estimation of the probability density of the input fail in achieving
  this task. In this work, we concentrate on the specific type of these models: Variational
  Autoencoders (VAEs). First, we unveil a significant theoretical flaw in the assumption
  of the classical VAE model. Second, we enforce an accommodating topological property
  to the image of the deep neural mapping to the latent space: compactness to alleviate
  the flaw and obtain the means to provably bound the image within the determined
  limits by squeezing both inliers and outliers together. We enforce compactness using
  two approaches: $(i)$ Alexandroff extension and  $(ii)$ fixed Lipschitz continuity
  constant on the mapping of the encoder of the VAEs. Finally and most importantly,
  we discover that the anomalous inputs predominantly tend to land on the vacant latent
  holes within the compact space, enabling their successful identification. For that
  reason, we introduce a specifically devised score for hole detection and evaluate
  the solution against several baseline benchmarks achieving promising results.'
