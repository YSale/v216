abstract: 'The problem of structure learning in Bayesian networks asks for a directed
  acyclic graph (DAG) that maximizes a given scoring function. Since the problem is
  NP-hard, research effort has been put into discovering restricted classes of DAGs
  for which the search problem can be solved in polynomial time. Here, we initiate
  investigation of questions that have received less attention thus far: Are the known
  polynomial algorithms close to the best possible, or is there room for significant
  improvements? If the interest is in Bayesian learning, that is, in sampling or weighted
  counting of DAGs, can we obtain similar complexity results? Focusing on DAGs with
  bounded vertex cover number—a class studied in Korhonen and Parviainen’s seminal
  work (NIPS 2015)—we answer the questions in the affirmative. We also give, apparently
  the first, proof that the counting problem is $#$P-hard in general. In addition,
  we show that under the vertex-cover constraint counting is $#$W[1]-hard.'
