abstract: Motivated by the problem of online canonical correlation analysis, we propose
  the <em>Stochastic Scaled-Gradient Descent</em> (SSGD) algorithm for minimizing
  the expectation of a stochastic function over a generic Riemannian manifold. SSGD
  generalizes the idea of projected stochastic gradient descent and allows the use
  of scaled stochastic gradients instead of stochastic gradients. In the special case
  of a spherical constraint, which arises in generalized eigenvector problems, we
  establish a nonasymptotic finite-sample bound of $\sqrt{1/T}$, and show that this
  rate is minimax optimal, up to a polylogarithmic factor of relevant parameters.
  On the asymptotic side, a novel trajectory-averaging argument allows us to achieve
  local asymptotic normality with a rate that matches that of Ruppert-Polyak-Juditsky
  averaging. We bring these ideas together in an application to online canonical correlation
  analysis, deriving, for the first time in the literature, an optimal one-time-scale
  algorithm with an explicit rate of local asymptotic convergence to normality. Numerical
  studies of canonical correlation analysis are also provided for synthetic data.
