abstract: Despite their incredible performance, it is well reported that deep neural
  networks tend to be overoptimistic about their prediction confidence. Finding effective
  and efficient calibration methods for neural networks is therefore an important
  endeavour towards better uncertainty quantification in deep learning. In this manuscript,
  we introduce a novel calibration technique named expectation consistency (EC), consisting
  of a post-training rescaling of the last layer weights by enforcing that the average
  validation confidence coincides with the average proportion of correct labels. First,
  we show that the EC method achieves similar calibration performance to temperature
  scaling (TS) across different neural network architectures and data sets, all while
  requiring similar validation samples and computational resources. However, we argue
  that EC provides a principled method grounded on a Bayesian optimality principle
  known as the Nishimori identity. Next, we provide an asymptotic characterization
  of both TS and EC in a synthetic setting and show that their performance crucially
  depends on the target function. In particular, we discuss examples where EC significantly
  outperforms TS.
