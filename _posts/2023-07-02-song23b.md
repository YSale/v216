abstract: Client selection schemes are widely adopted to handle the communication-efficient
  problems in recent studies of Federated Learning (FL). However, the large variance
  of the model updates aggregated from the randomly-selected unrepresentative subsets
  directly slows the FL convergence. We present a novel clustering-based client selection
  scheme to accelerate the FL convergence by variance reduction. Simple yet effective
  schemes are designed to improve the clustering effect and control the effect fluctuation,
  therefore, generating the client subset with certain representativeness of sampling.
  Theoretically, we demonstrate the improvement of the proposed scheme in variance
  reduction. We also present the tighter convergence guarantee of the proposed method
  thanks to the variance reduction. Experimental results confirm the exceed efficiency
  of our scheme compared to alternatives.
