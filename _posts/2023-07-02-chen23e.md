abstract: Privacy-aware multiagent systems must protect agents’ sensitive data while
  simultaneously ensuring that agents accomplish their shared objectives. Towards
  this goal, we propose a framework to privatize inter-agent communications in cooperative
  multiagent decision-making problems. We study sequential decision-making problems
  formulated as cooperative Markov games with reach-avoid objectives. We apply a differential
  privacy mechanism to privatize agents’ communicated symbolic state trajectories,
  and analyze tradeoffs between the strength of privacy and the team’s performance.
  For a given level of privacy, this tradeoff is shown to depend critically upon the
  total correlation among agents’ state-action processes. We synthesize policies that
  are robust to privacy by reducing the value of the total correlation. Numerical
  experiments demonstrate that the team’s performance under these policies decreases
  by only 6 percent when comparing private versus non-private implementations of communication.
  By contrast, the team’s performance decreases by 88 percent when using baseline
  policies that ignore total correlation and only optimize team performance.
