abstract: Given a (machine learning) classifier and a collection of unlabeled data,
  how can we efficiently identify misclassification patterns presented in this dataset?
  To address this problem, we propose a human-machine collaborative framework that
  consists of a team of human annotators and a sequential recommendation algorithm.
  The recommendation algorithm is conceptualized as a stochastic sampler that, in
  each round, queries the annotators a subset of samples for their true labels and
  obtains the feedback information on whether the samples are misclassified. The sampling
  mechanism needs to balance between discovering new patterns of misclassification
  (exploration) and confirming the potential patterns of classification (exploitation).
  We construct a determinantal point process, whose intensity balances the exploration-exploitation
  trade-off through the weighted update of the posterior at each round to form the
  generator of the stochastic sampler. The numerical results empirically demonstrate
  the competitive performance of our framework on multiple datasets at various signal-to-noise
  ratios.
