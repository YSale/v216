abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated great potentials in solving
  sequential decision making problems in many applications. Despite its promising
  performance, practical gaps exist when deploying DRL in real-world scenarios. One
  main barrier is the over-fitting issue that leads to poor generalizability of the
  policy learned by DRL. In particular, for offline DRL with observational data, model
  selection is a challenging task as there is no ground truth available for performance
  demonstration, in contrast with the online setting with simulated environments.
  In this work, we propose a pessimistic model selection (PMS) approach for offline
  DRL with a theoretical guarantee, which features a provably effective framework
  for finding the best policy among a set of candidate models. Two refined approaches
  are also proposed to address the potential bias of DRL model in identifying the
  optimal policy. Numerical studies demonstrated the superior performance of our approach
  over existing methods.
