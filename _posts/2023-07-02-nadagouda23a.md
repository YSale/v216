abstract: Active learning is commonly used to train label-efficient models by adaptively
  selecting the most informative queries. However, most active learning strategies
  are designed to either learn a representation of the data (e.g., embedding or metric
  learning) or perform well on a task (e.g., classification) on the data. However,
  many machine learning tasks involve a combination of both representation learning
  and a task-specific goal. Motivated by this, we propose a novel unified query framework
  that can be applied to any problem in which a key component is learning a representation
  of the data that reflects similarity. Our approach builds on similarity or nearest
  neighbor (NN) queries which seek to select samples that result in improved embeddings.
  The queries consist of a reference and a set of objects, with an oracle selecting
  the object most similar (i.e., nearest) to the reference. In order to reduce the
  number of solicited queries, they are chosen adaptively according to an information
  theoretic criterion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on
  two tasks - active metric learning and active classification - using a variety of
  synthetic and real world datasets. In particular, we demonstrate that actively selected
  NN queries outperform recently developed active triplet selection methods in a deep
  metric learning setting. Further, we show that in classification, actively selecting
  class labels can be reformulated as a process of selecting the most informative
  NN query, allowing direct application of our method.
