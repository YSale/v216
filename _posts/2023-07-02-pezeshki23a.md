abstract: 'Scientific computing has experienced a surge empowered by advancements
  in technologies such as neural networks.  However, certain important tasks are less
  amenable to these technologies, benefiting from innovations to traditional inference
  schemes.  One such task is protein re-design.  Recently a new re-design algorithm,
  {AOBB-K\textsuperscript{*}}, was introduced and was competitive with state-of-the-art
  {BBK\textsuperscript{*}} on small protein re-design problems. However, {AOBB-K\textsuperscript{*}}  did
  not scale well.  In this work, we focus on scaling up {AOBB-K\textsuperscript{*}}
  and introduce three new versions: {AOBB-K\textsuperscript{*}}-b (boosted), {AOBB-K\textsuperscript{*}}-{DH}
  (with dynamic heuristics), and {AOBB-K\textsuperscript{*}}-{UFO} (with underflow
  optimization) that significantly enhance scalability.'
