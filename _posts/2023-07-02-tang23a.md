abstract: 'We study a matrix recovery problem with unknown correspondence: given the
  observation matrix $M_o=[A,\tilde P B]$, where $\tilde P$ is an unknown permutation
  matrix, we aim to recover the underlying matrix $M=[A,B]$. Such problem commonly
  arises in many applications where heterogeneous data are utilized and the correspondence
  among them are unknown, e.g., due to data mishandling or privacy concern. We show
  that, in some applications, it is possible to recover $M$ via solving a nuclear
  norm minimization problem. Moreover, under a proper low-rank condition on $M$, we
  derive a non-asymptotic error bound for the recovery of $M$. We propose an algorithm,
  $\text{M}^3\text{O}$ (Matrix recovery via Min-Max Optimization) which recasts this
  combinatorial problem as a continuous minimax optimization problem and solves it
  by proximal gradient with a Max-Oracle. $\text{M}^3\text{O}$ can also be applied
  to a more general scenario where we have missing entries in $M_o$ and multiple groups
  of data with distinct unknown correspondence. Experiments on  simulated data, the
  MovieLens 100K dataset and Yale B database show that $\text{M}^3\text{O}$ achieves
  state-of-the-art performance over several baselines and can recover the ground-truth
  correspondence with high accuracy.'
