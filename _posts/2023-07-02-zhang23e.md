abstract: We consider the unlabeled linear regression reading as $\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{\Pi}^{*}\mathbf{X}\mathbf{B}^*
  + \mathbf{W}$, where $\mathbf{\Pi}^{*}, \mathbf{B}^*$ and $\mathbf{W}$ represents
  missing (or incomplete) correspondence information, signals, and additive noise,
  respectively. Our goal is to perform data alignment between $\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{X}$,
  or equivalently, reconstruct the correspondence information encoded by $\mathbf{\Pi}^*$.
  Based on whether signal $\mathbf{B}^*$ is given a prior, we separately propose two
  greedy-selection-based estimators, which both reach the mini-max optimality. Compared
  with previous works, our work $(i)$ supports partial recovery of the correspondence
  information; and $(ii)$ applies to a general matrix family rather than the permutation
  matrices, to put more specifically, selection matrices, where multiple rows of $\mathbf{X}$
  can correspond to the same row in $\mathbf{Y}$. Moreover, numerical experiments
  are provided to corroborate our claims.
