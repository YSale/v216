abstract: We present a novel Bayesian-based optimization framework that addresses
  the challenge of generalization in overparameterized models when dealing with imbalanced
  subgroups and limited samples per subgroup. Our proposed tri-level optimization
  framework utilizes <em>local</em> predictors, which are trained on a small amount
  of data, as well as a fair and class-balanced predictor at the middle and lower
  levels. To effectively overcome saddle points for minority classes, our lower-level
  formulation incorporates sharpness-aware minimization. Meanwhile, at the upper level,
  the framework dynamically adjusts the loss function based on validation loss, ensuring
  a close alignment between the <em>global</em> predictor and local predictors. Theoretical
  analysis demonstrates the frameworkâ€™s ability to enhance classification and fairness
  generalization, potentially resulting in improvements in the generalization bound.
  Empirical results validate the superior performance of our tri-level framework compared
  to existing state-of-the-art approaches. The source code can be found at \url{https://github.com/PennShenLab/FACIMS}.
