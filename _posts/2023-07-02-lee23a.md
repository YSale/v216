abstract: One fundamental problem in machine learning is out-of-distribution generalization.
  A method named the surgery estimator incorporates the causal structure in the form
  of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to find predictors that are invariant across target
  domains using distributional invariances via Pearlâ€™s do-calculus. However, finding
  a surgery estimator can take exponential time as the current methods need to search
  through all possible predictors. In this work, we first provide a graphical characterization
  of the identifiability of conditional causal queries. Next, we leverage this characterization
  together with a greedy search step to develop a polynomial-time algorithm for finding
  invariant predictors using the causal graph. Given the correct causal graph, our
  method is guaranteed to find at least one invariant predictor, if it exists. We
  show that our proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the run-time both in simulated
  and semi-synthetic data experiments and have predictive performance that is comparable
  to the existing work that runs in exponential time.
