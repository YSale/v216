abstract: We propose policy gradient algorithms for solving a risk-sensitive reinforcement
  learning (RL) problem in on-policy as well as off-policy settings. We consider episodic
  Markov decision processes, and model the risk using the broad class of smooth risk
  measures of the cumulative discounted reward. We propose two template policy gradient
  algorithms that optimize a smooth risk measure in on-policy and off-policy RL settings,
  respectively. We derive non-asymptotic bounds that quantify the rate of convergence
  of our proposed algorithms to a stationary point of the smooth risk measure. As
  special cases, we establish that our algorithms apply to optimization of mean-variance
  and distortion risk measures, respectively.
