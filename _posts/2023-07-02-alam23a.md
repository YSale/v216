abstract: In this paper, we present FLASH, a framework which addresses for the first
  time the central AutoML problem of Combined Algorithm Selection and HyperParameter
  (HP) Optimization (CASH) in the context of Federated Learning (FL). To limit training
  cost, FLASH incrementally adapts the set of algorithms to train based on their projected
  loss rates, while supporting decentralized (federated) implementation of the embedded
  hyper-parameter optimization (HPO), model selection and loss calculation problems.
  We provide a theoretical analysis of the training and validation loss under FLASH,
  and their tradeoff with the training cost measured as the data wasted in training
  sub-optimal algorithms. The bounds depend on the degree of dissimilarity between
  the datasets of the clients, a result of FL restriction that client datasets remain
  private. Through extensive experimental investigation on several datasets, we evaluate
  three variants of FLASH, and show that FLASH performs close to centralized CASH
  methods.
