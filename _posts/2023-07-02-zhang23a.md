abstract: "  Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents coordinates
  with teammate(s) for a shared goal, may sustain non-stationary caused by the policy
  change of teammates.  Prior works mainly concentrate on the policy change cross
  episodes,  ignoring the fact that teammates may suffer from sudden policy change
  within an episode, which might lead to miscoordination and poor performance. We
  formulate the problem as an open Dec-POMDP, where we control some agents to coordinate
  with uncontrolled teammates, whose policies could be changed within one episode.
  Then we develop a new framework \\textit{\\textbf{Fas}t \\textbf{t}eammates \\textbf{a}da\\textbf{p}tation
  (\\textbf{Fastap})} to address the problem. Concretely, we first train versatile
  teammates’ policies and assign them to different clusters via the Chinese Restaurant
  Process (CRP). Then, we train the controlled agent(s) to coordinate with the sampled
  uncontrolled teammates by capturing their identifications as context for fast adaptation.
  Finally, each agent applies its local information to anticipate the teammates’ context
  for decision-making accordingly. This process proceeds alternately, leading to a
  robust policy that can adapt to any teammates during the decentralized execution
  phase. We show in multiple multi-agent benchmarks that Fastap can achieve superior
  performance than multiple baselines in stationary and non-stationary scenarios. "
