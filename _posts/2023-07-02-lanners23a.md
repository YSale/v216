abstract: Our goal is to produce methods for observational causal inference that are
  auditable, easy to troubleshoot, yield accurate treatment effect estimates, and
  scalable to high-dimensional data. We describe a general framework called Model-to-Match
  that achieves these goals by (i) learning a distance metric via outcome modeling,
  (ii) creating matched groups using the distance metric, and (iii) using the matched
  groups to estimate treatment effects. Model-to-Match uses variable importance measurements
  to construct a distance metric, making it a flexible framework that can be adapted
  to various applications. Concentrating on the scalability of the problem in the
  number of potential confounders, we operationalize the Model-to-Match framework
  with LASSO. We derive performance guarantees for settings where LASSO outcome modeling
  consistently identifies all confounders (importantly without requiring the linear
  model to be correctly specified). We also provide experimental results demonstrating
  the auditability of matches, as well as extensions to more general nonparametric
  outcome modeling.
