abstract: In a sequential regression setting, a decision-maker may be primarily concerned
  with whether the future observation will increase or decrease compared to the current
  one, rather than the actual value of the future observation. In this context, we
  introduce the notion of parity calibration, which captures the goal of calibrated
  forecasting for the increase-decrease (or â€œparity") event in a timeseries. Parity
  probabilities can be extracted from a forecasted distribution for the output, but
  we show that such a strategy leads to theoretical unpredictability and poor practical
  performance. We then observe that although the original task was regression, parity
  calibration can be expressed as binary calibration. Drawing on this connection,
  we use an online binary calibration method to achieve parity calibration. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our approach on real-world case studies in epidemiology, weather
  forecasting, and model-based control in nuclear fusion.
