abstract: We propose functional causal Bayesian optimization (fCBO), a method for
  finding interventions that optimize a target variable in a known causal graph. fCBO
  extends the CBO family of methods to enable functional interventions, which set
  a variable to be a deterministic function of other variables in the graph. fCBO
  models the unknown objectives with Gaussian processes whose inputs are defined in
  a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, thus allowing to compute distances among vector-valued
  functions. In turn, this enables to sequentially select functions to explore by
  maximizing an expected improvement acquisition functional while keeping the typical
  computational tractability of standard BO settings. We introduce graphical criteria
  that establish when considering functional interventions allows attaining better
  target effects, and conditions under which selected interventions are also optimal
  for conditional target effects. We demonstrate the benefits of the method in a synthetic
  and in a real-world causal graph.
