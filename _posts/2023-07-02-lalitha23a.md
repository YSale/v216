abstract: 'We study the problem of best-arm identification (BAI) in the fixed-budget
  setting with heterogeneous reward variances. We propose two variance-adaptive BAI
  algorithms for this setting: SHVar for known reward variances and SHAdaVar for unknown
  reward variances. Our algorithms rely on non-uniform budget allocations among the
  arms where the arms with higher reward variances are pulled more often than those
  with lower variances. The main algorithmic novelty is in the design of SHAdaVar,
  which allocates budget greedily based on overestimating the unknown reward variances.
  We bound probabilities of misidentifying the best arms in both SHVar and SHAdaVar.
  Our analyses rely on novel lower bounds on the number of pulls of an arm that do
  not require closed-form solutions to the budget allocation problem. Since one of
  our budget allocation problems is analogous to the optimal experiment design with
  unknown variances, we believe that our results are of a broad interest. Our experiments
  validate our theory, and show that SHVar and SHAdaVar outperform algorithms from
  prior works with analytical guarantees.'
