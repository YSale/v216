abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable performance in computer
  vision. However, positional encoding in ViT makes it substantially difficult to
  learn the intrinsic equivariance in data. Ini- tial attempts have been made on designing
  equiv- ariant ViT but are proved defective in some cases in this paper. To address
  this issue, we design a Group Equivariant Vision Transformer (GE-ViT) via a novel,
  effective positional encoding opera- tor. We prove that GE-ViT meets all the theoreti-
  cal requirements of an equivariant neural network. Comprehensive experiments are
  conducted on standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating that GE-ViT significantly
  outperforms non-equivariant self-attention networks. The code is available at https://github.com/ZJUCDSYangKaifan/GEVit.
