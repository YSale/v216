abstract: Proper scoring rules incentivize experts to accurately report beliefs, assuming
  predictions cannot influence outcomes. We relax this assumption and investigate
  incentives when predictions are performative, i.e., when they can influence the
  outcome of the prediction, such as when making public predictions about the stock
  market. We say a prediction is a fixed point if it accurately reflects the expert’s
  beliefs after that prediction has been made. We show that in this setting, reports
  maximizing expected score generally do not reflect an expert’s beliefs, and we give
  bounds on the inaccuracy of such reports. We show that, for binary predictions,
  if the influence of the expert’s prediction on outcomes is bounded, it is possible
  to define scoring rules under which optimal reports are arbitrarily close to fixed
  points. However, this is impossible for predictions over more than two outcomes.
  We also perform numerical simulations in a toy setting, showing that our bounds
  are tight in some situations and that prediction error is often substantial (greater
  than 5-10%). Lastly, we discuss alternative notions of optimality, including performative
  stability, and show that they incentivize reporting fixed points.
