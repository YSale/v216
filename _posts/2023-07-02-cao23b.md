abstract: 'Distributions on integers are ubiquitous in probabilistic modeling but
  remain challenging for many of today’s probabilistic programming languages (PPLs).
  The core challenge comes from discrete structure: many of today’s PPL inference
  strategies rely on enumeration, sampling, or differentiation in order to scale,
  which fail for high-dimensional complex discrete distributions involving integers.
  Our insight is that there is structure in arithmetic that these approaches are not
  using. We present a binary encoding strategy for discrete distributions that exploits
  the rich logical structure of integer operations like summation and comparison.
  We leverage this structured encoding with knowledge compilation to perform exact
  probabilistic inference, and show that this approach scales to much larger integer
  distributions with arithmetic.'
