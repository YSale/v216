abstract: 'Studying the computational complexity and designing fast algorithms for
  determining winners under voting rules are classical and fundamental questions in
  computational social choice. In this paper, we accelerate voting by leveraging quantum
  computation: we propose a quantum-accelerated voting algorithm that can be applied
  to any anonymous voting rule. We show that our algorithm can be quadratically faster
  than any classical algorithm (based on sampling with replacement) under a wide range
  of common voting rules, including positional scoring rules, Copeland, and single
  transferable voting (STV). Precisely, our quantum-accelerated voting algorithm outputs
  the correct winner with high probability in $\Theta\left(\frac{n}{\text{MOV}}\right)$
  time, where $n$ is the number of votes and $\text{MOV}$ is <em>margin of victory</em>,
  the smallest number of voters to change the winner. In contrast, any classical voting
  algorithm based on sampling with replacement requires $\Omega\left(\frac{n^2}{\text{MOV}^2}\right)$
  time under a large class of voting rules. Our theoretical results are supported
  by experiments under plurality, Borda, Copeland, and STV.'
