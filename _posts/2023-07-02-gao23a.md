abstract: 'When perceiving the world from multiple viewpoints, humans have the ability
  to reason about the complete objects in a compositional manner even when an object
  is completely occluded from certain viewpoints. Meanwhile, humans are able to imagine
  novel views after observing multiple viewpoints. Recent remarkable advances in multi-view
  object-centric learning still leaves some unresolved problems: 1) The shapes of
  partially or completely occluded objects can not be well reconstructed. 2) The novel
  viewpoint prediction depends on expensive viewpoint annotations rather than implicit
  rules in view representations. In this paper, we introduce a time-conditioned generative
  model for videos. To reconstruct the complete shape of an object accurately, we
  enhance the disentanglement between the latent representations of objects and views,
  where the latent representations of time-conditioned views are jointly inferred
  with a Transformer and then are input to a sequential extension of Slot Attention
  to learn object-centric representations. In addition, Gaussian processes are employed
  as priors of view latent variables for video generation and novel-view prediction
  without viewpoint annotations. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that
  the proposed model can make object-centric video decomposition, reconstruct the
  complete shapes of occluded objects, and make novel-view predictions.'
