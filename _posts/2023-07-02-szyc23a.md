abstract: Reliable detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) instances is becoming a
  critical requirement for machine learning systems deployed in safety-critical applications.
  Recently, many OOD detectors have been developed in the literature, and their performance
  has been evaluated using empirical studies based on well-established benchmark datasets.
  However, these studies do not provide a conclusive recommendation because the performance
  of OOD detection depends on the benchmark datasets. In this work, we want to question
  the reliability of the OOD detection performance numbers obtained from many of these
  empirical experiments. We report several experimental conditions that are not controlled
  and lead to significant changes in OOD detector performance and rankings of OOD
  methods. These include the technicalities related to how the DNN was trained (such
  as seed, train/test split, etc.), which do not change the accuracy of closed-set
  DNN models but may significantly change the performance of OOD detection methods
  that rely on representation from these DNNs. We performed extensive sensitivity
  studies in image and text domains to quantify the instability of OOD performance
  measures due to unintuitive experimental factors. These factors need to be more
  rigorously controlled and accounted for in many current OOD experiments. Experimental
  studies in OOD detection should improve methodological standards regarding experiment
  control and replication.
