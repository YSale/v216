abstract: In this paper, we study a multi-agent bandit problem in an unknown general-sum
  game repeated for a number of rounds (i.e., learning in a black-box game with bandit
  feedback), where a set of agents have no information about the underlying game structure
  and cannot observe each other’s actions and rewards. In each round, each agent needs
  to play an arm (i.e., action) from a (possibly different) arm set (i.e., action
  set), and only receives the reward of the played arm that is affected by other agents’
  actions. The objective of each agent is to minimize her own cumulative swap regret,
  where the swap regret is a generic performance measure for online learning algorithms.
  We are the first to give a near-optimal high-probability swap-regret upper bound
  based on a refined martingale analysis for the exponential-weighting-based algorithms
  with the implicit exploration technique, which can further bound the expected swap
  regret instead of the pseudo-regret studied in the literature. It is also guaranteed
  that correlated equilibria can be achieved in a polynomial number of rounds if the
  algorithm is played by all agents. Furthermore, we conduct numerical experiments
  to verify the performance of the studied algorithm.
