abstract: Learning the kernel parameters for Gaussian processes is often the computational
  bottleneck in applications such as online learning, Bayesian optimization, or active
  learning. Amortizing parameter inference over different datasets is a promising
  approach to dramatically speed up training time. However, existing methods restrict
  the amortized inference procedure to a fixed kernel structure. The amortization
  network must be redesigned manually and trained again in case a different kernel
  is employed, which leads to a large overhead in design time and training time. We
  propose amortizing kernel parameter inference over a complete kernel-structure-family
  rather than a fixed kernel structure. We do that via defining an amortization network
  over pairs of datasets and kernel structures. This enables fast kernel inference
  for each element in the kernel family without retraining the amortization network.
  As a by-product, our amortization network is able to do fast ensembling over kernel
  structures. In our experiments, we show drastically reduced inference time combined
  with competitive test performance for a large set of kernels and datasets.
