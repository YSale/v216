abstract: Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs)
  formalize the problem of designing individual controllers for a group of collaborative
  agents under stochastic dynamics and partial observability. Seeking a global optimum
  is difficult (NEXP complete), but seeking a Nash equilibrium - each agent policy
  being a best response to the other agents - is more accessible, and allowed addressing
  infinite-horizon problems with solutions in the form of finite state controllers.
  In this paper, we show that this approach can be adapted to cases where only a generative
  model (a simulator) of the Dec-POMDP is available. This requires relying on a simulation-based
  POMDP solver to construct an agentâ€™s FSC node by node. A related process is used
  to heuristically derive initial FSCs. Experiment with benchmarks shows that MC-JESP
  is competitive with existing Dec-POMDP solvers, even better than many offline methods
  using explicit models.
