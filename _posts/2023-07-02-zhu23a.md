abstract: 'Imbalanced data is ubiquitous in machine learning, such as medical or fine-grained
  image datasets. The existing continual learning methods employ various techniques
  such as balanced sampling to improve classification accuracy in this setting. However,
  classification accuracy is not a suitable metric for imbalanced data, and hence
  these methods may not obtain a good classifier as measured by other metrics (e.g.,
  Area under the ROC Curve). In this paper, we propose a solution to enable efficient
  imbalanced continual learning by designing an algorithm to effectively maximize
  one widely used metric in an imbalanced data setting: Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).
  We find that simply replacing accuracy with AUC will cause <em>gradient interference
  problem</em> due to the imbalanced data distribution. To address this issue, we
  propose a new algorithm, namely DIANA, which performs a novel synthesis of model
  <b>D</b>ecoupl<b>I</b>ng <b>AN</b>d <b>A</b>lignment. In particular, the algorithm
  updates two models simultaneously: one focuses on learning the current knowledge
  while the other concentrates on reviewing previously-learned knowledge, and the
  two models gradually align during training. The results show that the proposed DIANA
  achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the imbalanced datasets compared with
  several competitive baselines.'
