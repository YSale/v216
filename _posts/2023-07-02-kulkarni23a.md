abstract: Crowdsourcing is an effective and efficient paradigm for obtaining labels
  for unlabeled corpus employing crowd workers. This work considers the budget allocation
  problem for a generalized setting on a graph of instances to be labeled where edges
  encode instance dependencies. Specifically, given a graph and a labeling budget,
  we propose an optimal policy to allocate the budget among the instances to maximize
  the overall labeling accuracy. We formulate the problem as a Bayesian Markov Decision
  Process (MDP), where we define our task as an optimization problem that maximizes
  the overall label accuracy under budget constraints. Then, we propose a novel stage-wise
  reward function that considers the effect of worker labels on the whole graph at
  each timestamp. This reward function is utilized to find an optimal policy for the
  optimization problem. Theoretically, we show that our proposed policies are consistent
  when the budget is infinite. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world
  graph datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed policies to achieve
  a higher label accuracy under budget constraints.
