abstract: Efficient exploration is critical in cooperative deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning (MARL). In this work, we propose an exploration method that effectively
  encourages cooperative exploration based on the idea of sequential action-computation
  scheme. The high-level intuition is that to perform optimism-based exploration,
  agents would explore cooperative strategies if each agent’s optimism estimate captures
  a structured dependency relationship with other agents. Assuming agents compute
  actions following a sequential order at <em>each environment timestep</em>, we provide
  a perspective to view MARL as tree search iterations by considering agents as nodes
  at different depths of the search tree. Inspired by the theoretically justified
  tree search algorithm UCT (Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees), we develop
  a method called Conditionally Optimistic Exploration (COE). COE augments each agent’s
  state-action value estimate with an action-conditioned optimistic bonus derived
  from the visitation count of the global state and joint actions of preceding agents.
  COE is performed during training and disabled at deployment, making it compatible
  with any value decomposition method for centralized training with decentralized
  execution. Experiments across various cooperative MARL benchmarks show that COE
  outperforms current state-of-the-art exploration methods on hard-exploration tasks.
